Several, like Homejoy, have recently gone bankrupt. Others have had to pivot to find a more sustainable business model. It turns out it&rsquo;s not so easy to offer your clients quality on-demand workers for a very low price: many workers will just not show up where they are expected. Angry users will never return and seek other alternatives.</p><p><em>When you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.</em> The sporadic nature of these low-paid gigs makes it impossible for many of these platforms to win the loyalty of the workers. Uber and TaskRabbit are accused of exploiting unqualified workers by offering low pay and no durable work prospects, when they should provide job security and better pay. There is a judicial battle in the US to have Uber drivers (contract workers) qualified as full employees, because, so goes the argument, you can&rsquo;t be an independent worker if you are entirely dependent on one company.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*bhOqnBKkK9nVQwuHzbZ5WQ.png\" data-width=\"480\" data-height=\"360\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"55\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*bhOqnBKkK9nVQwuHzbZ5WQ.png\" alt=\"Platforms: An Amazing Opportunity For The Creative Class\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*bhOqnBKkK9nVQwuHzbZ5WQ.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>The rise of platforms such as Uber has opened up an entire new field for litigation: are self-employed drivers in fact employees?</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>And yet, platforms aren&rsquo;t doomed. Some of them will change their models and ultimately offer workers better work conditions and higher pay if they want to serve their customers at the highest level of quality and scale. Others may even end up offering workers employee contracts if it&rsquo;s the best way to increase quality and economic viability. When it comes to creative class workers &mdash; consultants and architects, for example &mdash; the platformization of work has only just begun. Its development will unleash tremendous new opportunities, produce troughs of new work options and markets. Squeeze the middleman and you&rsquo;ll get more demand on one side and more offer on the other. Lower prices and higher pay. Can online platforms really do what corporations can&rsquo;t do? Well, nobody says it&rsquo;s easy, but it sure is possible.</p><h4><strong>The gig economy is redefining work as we know it</strong></h4><p>The platformization of work causes us to question the very meaning of work, employment, work relationships, insurance and the role of the state to protect a country&rsquo;s workers. As <a href=\"http://www.nickgrossman.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.nickgrossman.is/\">Nick Grossman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.elizabethwoyke.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.elizabethwoyke.com/\">Elizabeth Woyke</a> explain in their widely-discussed paper &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\"><em>Serving Workers in the Gig Economy</em></a>&rdquo;, the gig economy has completely unbundled the benefits and protections that have traditionally come with full-time employment, which means that &ldquo;<em>the different components of a job &mdash; income, structure, social connections, meaning, access to healthcare &mdash; which used to be bound together, are now becoming available from different places</em>&rdquo;.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*pa0AgyKQGvkOc9nMKX66IQ.png\" data-width=\"394\" data-height=\"194\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*pa0AgyKQGvkOc9nMKX66IQ.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*pa0AgyKQGvkOc9nMKX66IQ.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>Nick Grossman &amp; Elizabeth Woyke, authors of a landmark paper</em></figcaption></figure><p>The platformization of work, with the emergence of web and mobile marketplaces and work platforms such as Amazon&rsquo;s Mechanical Turk, <a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.upwork.com/\">UpWork</a> (the freelancer marketplace), and on-demand service platforms like Uber, Handy and Doctor on Demand, has accelerated the shift in the past 2 to 3 years.</p><p>Knowledge-based work is only now undergoing the same redefinition. It used to be that only writers and artists were free of the constraints of nine-to-five work days. Artists can&rsquo;t possibly be managed like regular workers. So instead of selling their brawn to a company, they sell their creations or performances on a gig basis to whoever will pay the price. What&rsquo;s new is that more traditional non-artistic professions are now following the same pattern: accountants, for example, have the job that most people would think is the least &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; job there can be (which is debatable), but they too can increasingly &lsquo;gigify&rsquo; their work on digital platforms. And they have a lot to gain from it!</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*j7jDJ2C7V52Dhk27fQ9R4g.png\" data-width=\"1058\" data-height=\"829\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*j7jDJ2C7V52Dhk27fQ9R4g.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*j7jDJ2C7V52Dhk27fQ9R4g.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*j7jDJ2C7V52Dhk27fQ9R4g.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>A study by Freelancers Union and Upwork revealed the prevalence of freelancing in the US</em></figcaption></figure><p>The gig economy now concerns a growing part of the US workforce. According to a <a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/press/2015/10/01/freelancers-union-and-upwork-release-new-study-revealing-insights-into-the-almost-54-million-people-freelancing-in-america/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.upwork.com/press/2015/10/01/freelancers-union-and-upwork-release-new-study-revealing-insights-into-the-almost-54-million-people-freelancing-in-america/\">study by Freelancers Union and UpWork</a>, in 2015, 54 million Americans &mdash; more than one third of the working population! &mdash; participated in some form of freelance work, often combined with salaried work. This huge number includes workers with all kinds of qualifications. Some are very well-paid. Others aren&rsquo;t. Some juggle different jobs. Others don&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s certain is that the trend is here to stay and is forcing us to question everything we take for granted.</p><h4><strong>Platforms really do make the cake bigger for low-qualified workers</strong></h4><p>For low-qualified workers, who go from gig to gig and sometimes can&rsquo;t make ends meet, platforms like Handy or Uber don&rsquo;t provide an easy life. But without digital platforms their situation would be worse. There is just more work because of these platforms. Corporations have been reducing their reliance on full-time workers for a long time, but the development of the work platforms has made it easier for them to offer more work than before, work that would previously have been performed by overworked employees or would not have been offered at all. As work can be unbundled into different tasks, in many shapes and sizes, there is less reluctance to hire a contract worker to perform a given task. Thus a wide array of new jobs and tasks can easily be offered that would otherwise not have existed.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*q9QW_uQj09uf-97cl2CBuA.png\" data-width=\"785\" data-height=\"675\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*q9QW_uQj09uf-97cl2CBuA.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"62\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*q9QW_uQj09uf-97cl2CBuA.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*q9QW_uQj09uf-97cl2CBuA.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>Uber&rsquo;s powerful network effects, as drawn by Yammer founder David Sacks</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Entire markets have been created or have expanded exponentially. Uber was obviously bad news for the taxi industries in large cities. But what Uber has proven is that the market for chauffeured transportation was infinitely bigger than the taxi market in these cities, big enough for hundreds of thousands of new drivers. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2015/05/01/the-numbers-behind-ubers-exploding-driver-force/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2015/05/01/the-numbers-behind-ubers-exploding-driver-force/\">Hundreds of thousands!</a>There are clearly many poorer passengers the taxis could never target. The network effects of two-sided markets simply expanded the existing market enormously&mdash;and could have expanded it even more were it not for restricting regulations.</p><h4><strong>Platforms contribute to market transparency for better worker revenues</strong></h4><p>Founded in 2015, <a href=\"http://dispatcher.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://dispatcher.com/\">Dispatcher</a> is a new app that matches gig workers with jobs. Its cofounders want to build a real-time labor exchange for the gig economy, similar to an ad exchange, to empower the on-demand workforce. It mediates the relationship between the worker and the work platform and serves as an &lsquo;agent&rsquo; for the worker, helping him/her make the best decisions about where and when to work. As Robert Yau, <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\">Dispatcher&rsquo;s founder explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our vision in the future is to potentially predict what are the best jobs based on location and time. So workers can pick and choose, essentially. It Uber&rsquo;s paying me $20/hour while Postmaster, because it&rsquo;s dinner, is paying me $30/hour, a worker may decide to do Postmates rather than Uber. Today, they don&rsquo;t have that visibility. The thinking is that, with Dispatcher, when we become the labor exchange, that visibility will get exposed&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*q15wSftaDWzdqzZYtx3tvQ.png\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"333\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"47\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*q15wSftaDWzdqzZYtx3tvQ.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*q15wSftaDWzdqzZYtx3tvQ.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>Robert Yau, the founder of Dispatcher.com</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h4>The critical vision of Dispatcher is that price transparency can be brought to the marketplace, to the benefit of the worker!</h4><p>Platforms have made it possible for middle-class individuals to increase their revenues when these revenues had been stagnating or declining for decades. A large part of the independent contractors who find work on those platforms already have full-time or part-time jobs but want to or need to work more to increase their revenues. As is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-class_squeeze\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-class_squeeze\">now well-documented</a>, the revenues of middle-class Westerners have declined over the last two decades. To simply make ends meet, most people need to be very creative. The many platforms of the digital economy have made gigs and property-sharing sources of revenue (renting the things you own, as with Airbnb) easily available.</p><p>For highly-qualified workers, digital platforms offer the promise of a just reward. Good ratings and reviews can make a profile more attractive for a company seeking talent. Why rely on an old-fashioned CV if one can actually prove one&rsquo;s worth online? It is naturally critical for the workers to have control over their data. Data portability (from one platform to the other) is a big issue worth fighting for. And leaving the right digital traces is a skill worth acquiring.</p><h4><strong>There is now a whole new ecosystem of services for workers</strong></h4><p>AsNick Grossman and Elizabeth Woyke show in <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\"><em>Serving Workers in the Gig Economy</em></a><em>, t</em>hese services all have a common theme, &ldquo;<em>the desire to retain the flexibility and freedom of gig work, while obtaining the protections and benefits of traditional full-time work</em>&rdquo;. So independent workers can have their cake and eat it too. The main difficulty about being a freelancer (without a salaried work on the side) was access to benefits and protections. The safety net &mdash; benefits such as unemployment, disability and retirement &mdash; bundled with work, is part of a package that&rsquo;s invisible&hellip; and taken for granted. But there are new kinds of insurance products that address freelancers. For example, <a href=\"http://www.peers.org/product/freelancers-union-national-benefits-platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.peers.org/product/freelancers-union-national-benefits-platform/\">Peers</a> offers a program of portable benefits that stay with the worker regardless of employer. <a href=\"https://even.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://even.me/\">Even</a> offers a banking product that helps hourly workers manage the ups and downs of an unpredictable work schedule and income.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*aqCjbehB3F5-AAalZJz4bA.png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*aqCjbehB3F5-AAalZJz4bA.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"40\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aqCjbehB3F5-AAalZJz4bA.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aqCjbehB3F5-AAalZJz4bA.png\" /></div></div></figure><h4><strong>For the creative class, platforms are an amazing opportunity</strong></h4><p>Highly-qualified workers have embraced the gig economy with enthusiasm. A higher number of the so-called &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo; are happy to escape the &ldquo;prison&rdquo; of salaried work. Take programmers. They&rsquo;re in such high demand that they welcome the opportunity to become independent and get paid more. For those who work fast, it&rsquo;s easier to combine multiple jobs, and leave the jobs that are less exciting. HR people will have to learn the right ways to appeal to the best freelance talent: offer them flexibility and exciting projects.</p><p>The &ldquo;Creative Class&rdquo; is a socioeconomic class identified by American economist Richard Florida. According to him, creative class workers are a key force for economic development of post-industrial cities in the developed world. In the US, they represent 30% of the total workforce. They are made of two groups:</p><ul><li>the &ldquo;super creative core&rdquo; (13% of all US jobs) includes scientists, engineers, programmers, researchers, professors, artists and designers. Their primary function is to be creative and innovative. They find the problems and solve them.</li><li>the &lsquo;creative professionals&rsquo; are the classic knowledge-based workers who work in business, finance, healthcare, legal or education. They solve specific problems.</li></ul><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*cmHss28yNbkPcqNrpMQXHQ.png\" data-width=\"400\" data-height=\"345\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"62\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*cmHss28yNbkPcqNrpMQXHQ.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*cmHss28yNbkPcqNrpMQXHQ.png\" /></div></div></figure><p>Both the super creative core and the creative professionals have long enjoyed more autonomy and flexibility in their work. Some professions (like lawyers and doctors) were traditionally independent workers, but others among the creative professionals have long been the employees of big corporations which act as middlemen between problems and problem solvers.</p><p>Consultants are a case in point. For a hundred years, big consulting firms have hired young creative talent to solve their clients&rsquo; specific problems. Their model has consisted in overcharging companies for the consulting services of junior consultants. That worked quite well because these young consultants could just copy-paste the work of their elders. Alas, fewer companies today accept to pay so much for copy-paste work. More of them demand customized services by experienced workers. So the model is coming to a halt. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean consulting is dead! Indeed they can increasingly sell their services directly to the companies that need them. Algorithms can match the right workers with the companies that require their specific skills.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*aFA6Ry8GMJTu5mMuvRDDcg.png\" data-width=\"732\" data-height=\"452\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*aFA6Ry8GMJTu5mMuvRDDcg.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"45\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*aFA6Ry8GMJTu5mMuvRDDcg.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*aFA6Ry8GMJTu5mMuvRDDcg.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>HourlyNerd co-founders Patrick Petitti, Rob Biederman</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>New platforms have emerged that offer to connect qualified workers directly with the companies (or people) whose problems need to be solved. For example, HourlyNerd is a Boston-based global online marketplace that connects big and small companies with over 20,000 independent business consultants for project-based work. Clients post projects, receive bids, select experts and make payment on the platform. Another example of a platform on which high-skilled workers offer their services is CoContest, which is known as the &lsquo;Uber of interior designers&rsquo;. (Funnily enough, a majority of the designers who participate in the contests on the website are Italian.)</p><h4><strong>Let&rsquo;s make sure we play our cards right if we want to get more work</strong></h4><p>First let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves about the ability of some of these gigantic platforms to become predators. If every gig worker is a small company, then identity and personal reputation are their brand and professional card. If so much is mediated by platforms, it it critical that the workers control their data. Reputation gained on one platform could be used to obtain income from another platform. So data portability would give workers more flexibility to choose where and how to work. Right now, by default, the data generated is the property of the platform rather than that of the worker. Mature platforms prefer to keep their users&rsquo; reputation value within their own system, which will only increase the winner-take-all trend towards gigantism. It&rsquo;s important to make data portability an issue and favor the small newer platforms that use data portability as an argument.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*lq--EFpgNuRW5gUYkz2gLA.png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"533\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*lq--EFpgNuRW5gUYkz2gLA.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"47\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*lq--EFpgNuRW5gUYkz2gLA.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*lq--EFpgNuRW5gUYkz2gLA.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>With the Next: Economy conference, Tim O&rsquo;Reilly (left) tackles the challenge of stressing the advantages of platforms from the workforce&rsquo;s point of view</em></figcaption></figure><p>Second let&rsquo;s make policymakers aware of the value that work platforms can have for workers. Lobbying and raising awareness is critical to have governments on the side of gig workers. Rather than <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/uber-suspends-controversial-uberpop-france-103700420.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/uber-suspends-controversial-uberpop-france-103700420.html\">banning</a> the platforms, they could incentivize platforms to adopt a model with more protections. Work platforms opt toward a model of independent contractors because of the transactional costs and friction of the employment paperwork. If these burdensome and costly processes could be made into digital, instant, API-driven processes, then there could be more protections from the start!</p><p>On a more individual level, we need to embrace what amounts to a paradigm shift. Deconstructing work as we have always known it (in companies) is scary. But platforms will be a boon if we play our cards right. Let&rsquo;s choose the right platforms and boost our work prospects!</p><figure><div><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2-2-300x225.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2-2-300x225.png 300w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2-2-768x576.png 768w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2-2.png 800w\" alt=\"426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2 2\" width=\"527\" height=\"395\" /></div></figure></div>",

But just because it feeds your ego or makes you feel important, that <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/08/the-research-is-clear-long-hours-backfire-for-people-and-for-companies\" target=\"_blank\">doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s actually good for you</a>. How do you break the cycle of working long hours at the office and constantly checking email at home? How do you persuade those around you &mdash; similarly work-obsessed colleagues or a demanding boss &mdash; that working all the time isn&rsquo;t healthy? How can you reset the expectations of your manager and coworkers?</p><p><strong>What the Experts Say</strong><br /> In a society &ldquo;where work is considered morally worthy,&rdquo; being a workaholic might not seem like a serious problem, says <a href=\"http://sociology.ucsd.edu/faculty/bio/documents/Blair-LoyWhartonANNALS2004.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Blair-Loy</a>, a sociologist and the founding director of the Center for Research on Gender in the Professions at the University of California, San Diego. &ldquo;We live in a culture where work demands and deserves our undivided allegiance,&rdquo; she says. And that sort of devotion does have its benefits. &ldquo;You feel challenged by your work; you&rsquo;re engaged by it; you&rsquo;re learning new things; and you have the opportunity to shape other people&rsquo;s careers. It&rsquo;s extremely rewarding,&rdquo; she says. But when you give all your attention to work, you eventually pay a steep price, according to Stewart Friedman, professor of management at the Wharton School and author of <a target=\"_blank\"><em>Leading the Life You Want: Skills for Integrating Work and Life</em></a>. Working long hours, taking few vacations, and never truly being &ldquo;off&rdquo; &mdash; because of the ubiquity of digital devices &mdash; is &ldquo;harmful to your relationships, your health, and also your productivity,&rdquo; he says. Here are some tips to help you overcome your addiction.</p><p><strong>Redefine success</strong><br /> Start by rethinking how you define success. <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/05/overcome-your-work-addiction.html\" target=\"_blank\">Workaholics</a> tend to be perfectionists who are always aiming to get ahead. Professional achievements are well and good, of course, but to <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2010/07/how-will-you-measure-your-life\" target=\"_blank\">live a truly full life</a> you also need to &ldquo;have purpose and <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/13/happy-workaholics-need-boundaries-not-balance\" target=\"_blank\">draw a boundary line</a>that shows respect for your family life, physical health, and spiritual health,&rdquo; says Friedman. In other words, your self-worth should not revolve around your status, paycheck, and prestige; it should take into account the quality of your relationships, your engagement in your community, and your physical and emotional well-being. Remember too that you can&rsquo;t be the best at everything, says Blair-Loy, so try not to be too hard on yourself. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be the perfect worker, the perfect parent, a triathlete, or someone who reads The Economist from cover to cover,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have superhuman expectations.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Refocus your attention</strong><br /> Next, you need to step back and reflect on how you want to spend your time and energy. &ldquo;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/09/work-home-community-self\" target=\"_blank\">Think about what matters</a>,&rdquo; Friedman says. &ldquo;As you&rsquo;re trying to establish meaningful connections and advance your career, attention is your most precious asset.&rdquo; How do you want to invest it? &ldquo;You have a lot more control over those things than you think.&rdquo; There will always be more work to be done, but make the conscious choice to spend time elsewhere: with family, with friends, or in your community. Blair-Loy suggests focusing on one thing at a time &mdash; stop multitasking. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re out with your spouse or watching a baseball game with your kid and you take a call from work or check email, you&rsquo;re cheating them&rdquo; out of time with you, she says. Multitasking is not just rude; it&rsquo;s also ineffective. &ldquo;You may get some minor extra credit at work for that quick response, but it&rsquo;s not a thoughtful reply,&rdquo; she explains. Give the person you&rsquo;re with your full concentration for a certain period of time, then allow yourself a five-minute time-out to deal with whatever work has come in.</p><p><strong>Reset expectations</strong><br /> When trying to break an addiction, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t do it alone,&rdquo; says Friedman. He suggests enlisting the help of colleagues, family, and friends for &ldquo;accountability and support.&rdquo; Resetting the expectations of your boss and coworkers requires that you be clear about the changes you&rsquo;re making and why you&rsquo;re making them. Explain to your boss and coworkers why &ldquo;it&rsquo;s in their best interest&rdquo; to help you disengage. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be a matter of asking them to help you disconnect so that you can be with your family. They have to see the benefit to themselves,&rdquo; he says. Friedman recommends saying something like, &ldquo;In the next month, I&rsquo;m going to be offline after 4 PM every Tuesday. I think you&rsquo;re going to see an improvement in my performance because I will be able to take care of some things in my personal life, and I will be less distracted. After a month of trying this, we will talk about it how it went for both of us.&rdquo; Blair-Loy agrees: Being up front and direct about your plans to &ldquo;create time in your day when you can&rsquo;t be interrupted&rdquo; allows you more flexibility to mold your schedule and also helps &ldquo;manage expectations&rdquo; within your team.</p><p><strong>Experiment with digital detoxes</strong><br /> You don&rsquo;t have to be a work addict to be a slave to your smartphone &mdash; what Friedman calls &ldquo;a reactive robot twitching every time you&rsquo;re called upon.&rdquo; When &ldquo;you&rsquo;re physically present but psychologically absent, you&rsquo;re saying to the people who are with you that they are less important.&rdquo; When it comes to <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/04/what-happens-when-you-really-d\" target=\"_blank\">digital detoxing</a>, &ldquo;there is no one solution that works for everyone.&rdquo; So you should experiment. Here are some suggestions:</p><ul><li><strong>Hide your smartphone.</strong>There&rsquo;s no reason to keep your smartphone within reach after the workday is done. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re in the office, would you ever park your kid in the corner in case he needed something?&rdquo; Blair Loy asks. &ldquo;No. So why, when you&rsquo;re at home at night with your family, would you have your work parked in the corner in case it needs you?&rdquo; She points to <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/docs/e-web/academics/communications/research/vol6no1/02DragoEJSpring15.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">studies</a> that have shown how the mere presence of a phone between two people affects the quality and content of their conversation. &ldquo;Communication is more shallow because we know it we can be interrupted by a ping or a buzz at any moment,&rdquo; she says.</li><li><strong>Stop using your phone as a time-filler.</strong>Many of us, workaholics especially, turn to their phones &ldquo;whenever there&rsquo;s a free moment,&rdquo; says Friedman &mdash; waiting in line at the office cafeteria, between conversations at a networking event, in the conference room before colleagues arrive. &ldquo;You turn to your screen as a social crutch when you&rsquo;re anxious&rdquo; or bored, he says. Resist this impulse by doing <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/04/how-to-overcome-burnout-and-stay-motivated\" target=\"_blank\">something you enjoy or look forward to</a>, he says. At first it &ldquo;might feel uncomfortable&rdquo; &mdash; after all, reaching for your phone to fill the time can be a tough habit to break &mdash; but it will help you &ldquo;be in the moment,&rdquo; which will allow you to &ldquo;stop and smell the flowers.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Model better manners at the office.</strong> &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how normative it is in your organization&rdquo; to be constantly tapping away on your phone when someone else is talking, Friedman says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s disrespectful.&rdquo; As a leader, you&rsquo;re setting an example. Your team is learning about professionalism from you, and they will repeat these behaviors in front of clients and others. &ldquo;You influence your environment,&rdquo; he says.</li></ul><p><strong>Practice mindfulness</strong><br /> A growing body of evidence suggests that practicing nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness &mdash; also known as <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/03/how-to-practice-mindfulness-throughout-your-work-day\" target=\"_blank\">mindfulness</a> &mdash; helps people become more mentally flexible and make better decisions. For people trying to break an addiction to work, mindfulness training can therefore be &ldquo;extremely valuable,&rdquo; according to Friedman. &ldquo;It helps you get a sense of control and purpose and be conscious and deliberate about your choices.&rdquo; Blair- Loy recommends meditation in particular. &ldquo;It helps to take a few breaths before acting,&rdquo; she says.</p><p><strong>Prioritize your health &mdash; for the sake of others</strong><br /> As you shift priorities, also remember to take care of yourself. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t work productively in a creative and nuanced way for more than a certain number of hours per day &mdash; and you certainly can&rsquo;t do it without proper sleep, nutrition, and exercise,&rdquo; says Blair-Loy. Numerous studies show that people who prioritize <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/07/is-the-life-youre-living-worth.html\" target=\"_blank\">their health</a> &mdash; eating well, taking breaks and time off, and getting plenty of exercise &mdash; <a href=\"https://hbr.org/ideacast/2016/01/being-happier-at-work\" target=\"_blank\">have more energy</a>and better focus. Of course, warns Friedman, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re [only] thinking about these things out of your own interest, it&rsquo;s not going to be sustainable.&rdquo; You must also think about the other people &mdash; clients, friends, coworkers, and family &mdash; who count on you and your good health. &ldquo;That mindset changes your motivation,&rdquo; he says.</p><p><strong>Principles to Remember</strong></p><p><strong>Do:</strong></p><ul><li>Redefine personal success to be more about high-quality relationships, community engagement, and physical and spiritual wellness.</li><li>Be deliberate about how you choose to spend your time and with whom you spend it.</li><li>Try mindfulness.</li></ul><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t:</strong></p><ul><li>Go it alone &mdash; enlist colleagues, family, and friends to help you disengage.</li><li>Automatically reach for your phone whenever you have a down moment.</li><li>Skimp on exercise, sleep, and wholesome food.</li></ul><p><strong>Case Study #1: Seek encouragement and reset your colleagues&rsquo; expectations</strong><br /> Amanda Sowadski, a former corporate director of business operations based in Minneapolis, first realized she was a workaholic after landing in the ER with a panic attack. The doctor prescribed Xanax, and Amanda knew then that &ldquo;something had to change.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;In hindsight, losing many of my relationships with anyone outside of work because I was too busy at the office should have been a clue,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>To change her workaholic ways, she sought support from her husband. &ldquo;I asked him to keep me accountable to leaving work at a certain time,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I had him call me at 6 PM, which felt more reasonable than 5 PM, and stay on the phone until I left the building.&rdquo;</p><p>She then took control over her electronics at home. She turned her phone off at 8 PM and only turned it on again at 7 AM. &ldquo;This allowed me time to unwind in the evening and time to ease into my day without rushing to check email as soon as I turned the alarm off,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I also stopped sending emails to my team after hours and on the weekends, [because doing that] <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/your-late-night-emails-are-hurting-your-team\" target=\"_blank\">perpetuates the cycle of frenzy</a>.&rdquo;</p><p>Amanda reset the expectations of her manager by making a gradual shift in the number of hours she worked. &ldquo;I ensured I was still meeting my deadlines, but I started to say no more often so I could prioritize the 20% of things that had 80% of the impact,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Another way she conquered her addiction to work was by learning to meditate. &ldquo;It helps me stay more present and enjoy life when I am not at work,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Once I was enjoying life again I realized how much I had made work my worth, and it was easier to continue to gradually cut back because I had hobbies and friends to see again.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Case Study #2: Take control of your use of electronics</strong><br /> Mareza Larizadeh has many jobs and many roles: He&rsquo;s an angel investor in Bonobos, the founder of VC-backed executive search site Doostang, and the CEO of pulsd, an online concierge startup based in New York.</p><p>A couple of years ago, because of his many professional activities, he realized that &ldquo;all of [his] time and energy was spent on work.&rdquo; It was unhealthy and he needed to put work in perspective. &ldquo;It was time for a change,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Mareza created several &ldquo;super simple&rdquo; rules to limit his use of electronics. For instance, he only checks email at 5 PM during the work week. &ldquo;[This way] I&rsquo;m less tempted to break my flow with constant email checks,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;When someone has something important to tell me, they will call or CC a colleague, who will then tell me I need to respond to something quickly.&rdquo;</p><p>As a founder, Mareza used to be always &ldquo;on call&rdquo; for emergencies, but since the company has grown he delegates noncritical issues to colleagues on weekends.</p><p>Mareza has an iPhone, but he rarely checks email on Saturdays and Sundays. He doesn&rsquo;t text often, and he turns off notifications for most apps. &ldquo;You can live in the moment and appreciate the people you are with once you disconnect for a few hours,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Most importantly, he started prioritizing his health and well-being. &ldquo;I sleep more and travel less,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>The changes had a positive effect on him and his coworkers. &ldquo;They see how much happier I am when I am well rested,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Everyone at the company is doing better.&rdquo;</p>",

        "content": "<p>April 12, 2016 &ndash; <a href=\"https://hbr.org/search?term=joseph+e.+aoun\">Joseph E. Aoun</a> &ndash; HBR</p><p>It’s that time of year when college students are interviewing for the jobs they hope to hold after graduation. But in addition to such familiar jobs such as engineer, consultant, or financial analyst, we’re increasingly seeing new job titles emerge: forensic technologist, digital storyteller, and marketing automation manager.</p><p>Labor market data tell us that these “hybrid” jobs are rapidly on the rise. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiipIaGhofMAhUKMz4KHaTcBfQQFggdMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fburning-glass.com%2Fresearch%2Fhybrid-jobs%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFPCSuzszlbVBJ9VQxnRaZwrePVaQ&amp;sig2=nW0z9H3y0mT49R2eJhzeEw\" target=\"_blank\">According to a report</a> by workforce analytics firm Burning Glass, more than a quarter million such positions opened up between April 2014 and March 2015. These jobs—many of them in high paying fields like user experience design—call for skill sets that aren’t customarily taught as a package. For example, positions in mobile development, which combines skills from engineering, coding, and computer science, have grown by 135 percent since 2011.</p><p>What does this mean for colleges and universities? If the new jobs that are emerging are increasingly hybrid, then the programs of study may need to become hybridized as well.</p><p>My own discussions with employers across a range of industries back this up. In addition to confirming the well-known shortage of talent in STEM fields, they say that the employees who are in highest demand are those who can work in complex teams and think across complex systems. Employers are looking for the sort of professional who can lead a team that includes, for instance, an engineer, a coder, and a data scientist, effectively understanding all the distinct roles and coordinating across them.</p><p>The right type of education for nurturing this kind of “systems thinking” capacity needs to be both broad and deep; expertise in a single domain won’t suffice. For example, Pete McCabe, Vice President of Global Services at GE Transportation, recently mentioned that his industry is in need of more “quarterbacks”: in other words, systems thinkers who oversee a team of specialists to solve a common problem. “Knowing how to plug, knowing where to push,” he says. “I’d give my left pinky for ten more of those people.”</p><p>Likewise, Andrea Cox, of GE’s Aviation Engineering division, describes how their teams might be made of hundreds of specialists, ranging from material engineers to designers, all of them thinking about different elements of an airplane’s engine design. All of them, though, have to be able to grasp the wider endeavor of keeping a plane in the air. “A design engineer has to understand how a part operates,” she notes, “but also how it fits into the design of its module, and then how the module fits into an engine, and how the engine fits into an airplane.”</p><p>To be sure, in the economy of the future, a typical employee still will need deep knowledge of one domain, or more. But how can colleges teach a broader form of systems thinking to tomorrow’s graduates? I believe it involves three key elements: thematic study across disciplines, project-based learning, and experiential opportunities. For example, at the university I lead, students interested in sustainability don’t just study environmental science. Rather, they also take courses that expose them to relevant concepts in engineering, physics, economics, data analysis, health sciences, urban planning, and the law—the range of disciplines they’d likely encounter if they worked on sustainability in the real world.</p><p>Furthermore, the courses students take don’t consider these subjects in silos. Instead, they feature hands-on projects that give students the opportunity to synthesize knowledge across different fields—for instance, building “biomimetic” robots that move like sea creatures, and are equipped with sensors that can measure shifts in ocean temperatures.</p><p>Finally, experiential learning opportunities, such as internships and co-ops, can give students an opportunity to apply this synthesis in an on-the-ground context, with all its nuances and idiosyncrasies. For example, one of our students recently tested her learning by working at a co-op with the Panama Canal Authority—where, among other things, she led a project to design and cost out rainwater harvesting systems to benefit rural schools within the canal’s watershed. By requiring her to integrate concepts from engineering, environmental science, economics, and more, the experience was an immersion into how systems thinking plays out in the real world.</p><p>Indeed, students may need even more than all this to master the jobs and skill sets that will be the hallmarks of our future economy. That’s because beyond the rise of complex teams in workplaces, we’re also seeing the emergence of complex systems architecture in the world around us—in other words, the increasingly intricate nexus between hardware, software, and human beings. Our smartphones are becoming ever more sophisticated, driverless cars will soon be on our roads, and we’re seeing the dawn of the Internet of Things.</p><p>Ultimately, this highly connected world will usher in a new era of higher education—one that is focused on helping students understand how deeply networked systems of people, programs, and machines join together to make our workplaces function.</p><p>Like society itself, the job market is becoming ever more complex. By exposing students to systems thinking, higher education can prepare them to do the systems-oriented work needed for tomorrow’s jobs.</p>",

        "title": "Interview with Candice Gasperini, co-founder of BRICOOL",
        "content": "<p></p><div><b>What is BRICOOL?</b></div><div>Bricool is positioned as the concierge for small and large works. The term concierge is overused but it perfectly expresses the idea of accompaniment and minimal involvement for the client. We search in our network service providers matching his need, we compare the specifications to ensure we have an interesting and competitive price, recommend and assist him until the completion of his construction.</div><p></p><div><b>Is there a vision of a founder to its origin? What was the DNA of your company?</b></div><div>Last summer when I had to buy an apartment, I found myself at a loss when starting works of construction. Where to start ? Who to call? How to ensure they have fair prices? Emilie, my partner, had small works to do, and she had no desire to have to ask again relatives, friends.</div><div>We therefore analyzed the existing services, nothing met our need, namely: &#8220;I know nothing about it, help me! &#8220;And above all I did not have time to take care and look for the right provider. Between marketplaces that work as reverse auction and the multi-estimations sites to which one must have a minimum of expertise, we could not find the trusted intermediary. One that ensures reliable provider matching demand and guaranteeing fair prices. It sounds simple but in such a deregulated sector with stakeholders accustomed to bad practices it is a challenge!</div><div>We are used to say that we address all the &#8220;outsiders DIY&#8221;, ie all those who do not know or just do not have time. We have an urban clientele but we address to both active thirties as seniors or people with disabilities who are in particular need to be reassured.</div><p></p><div><b>What are the highlights of its history, major developments?</b></div><div>Emily and I met at the Wagon, best bootcamp France, 9 intensive weeks to learn how to code. Our meeting was a real friendly heart stroke. We then looked for a project on which we could form a partnership. It took almost a year because we really wanted to find the subject on which we felt a real &#8220;pain point&#8221;. We have therefore started by encoding a platform together. And then we met Oussama Amar of The Family, a turning point. Oussama immediately advised us to stop coding and start testing our service. It is useless to provide a platform if it does not match the customer uses. Feel its market to understand how to adapt and build the product’s bricks one by one. The famous &#8220;test &amp; learn&#8221; is the best advice we have been given.</div><p></p><div><b>What is the company policy that you have with your employees?</b></div><div>We are a young startup, which requires a particular mindset, flexibility is the foundation of BRICOOL. With our employees (and even when they are freelancers) we do not operate on a vertical, hierarchical mode. Each member must act as a true entrepreneur and share with others the knowledge he has of his business domain to develop innovative ideas.</div><p></p><div><b>What is your relationship to the CDI?</b></div><div>We&#8217;re not there yet. We soon will be in the fundraising phase, we will talk about CDI at that time. In addition to our employees, the issue of CDI has arisen with our providers. Will we integrate them internally as for the &#8220;rescuers&#8221; of Save? The advantage is of course to standardize the service, to train recruits, to eradicate bad practices. The drawback, of course, we all know it, is the cost. But not only. We quickly found that many of our providers had chosen to leave the wage to become entrepreneur. To offer a CDI seemed to us to be a decline in this sector. Perhaps we will change our opinion in the future but for now it seems to be the right choice.</div><p></p><div><b>Are you positioned on a high turnover industry ? If so what are the main reasons?</b></div><div>Indeed. This is one of  the causes of failures of some of our US counterparts. In addition, our industry is highly competitive. How, then, retain the best providers? It seems necessary to devote a substantial budget to their onboarding and retention. This happens in the human relationship, that we favor. Many of them have already notified us of the difference of our devotion to them compared to our competitors. In addition, we will organize regular events in the near future that will allow us to establish a concept of &#8220;community&#8221; among our bricoolers. One may be self-employed and feel a full member of a company. This is a design of the new work. We want our bricoolers be happy and proud to be labeled BRICOOL.</div><p></p><div><b>Your HR policy does it take into account the fragmentation of the working world?</b></div><div>Construction was already &#8220;ubérisé&#8221; a long time ago, the craftsman’s status is not new. However, we are witnessing a new fragmentation. Let&#8217;s say we are the fruit of this evolution because BRICOOL is partly due to the emergence of the auto-entrepreneur status. It renews the market by bringing a new breath to a gamy sector. Many of our suppliers have recently left their salaried position in construction companies to start their own. This allows them to have a contact with customers they didn’t have until then. But above all it is more freedom and satisfaction of being your own boss. For us it is the insurance to work with actors who don’t have integrated the bad practices yet. They are also more flexible and their lower costs enable us to offer our clients competitive rates.</div>",

        "content": "<p></p><p><em>Nicolas Sultan, after a 17 years career in the world of consulting, is currently Deputy Director of CapGemini Council.</em></p><p><strong>What was your career pathway ?</strong></p><p>My path was rather classic, I went to a business school, and then I went to Sciences Po. At first I was thinking about working in consulting, but I wanted to go to ENA. Finally different opportunities have led me to consulting when I joined Mars in early career.</p><p><strong>Precisely what were the meetings, opportunities that have marked you?</strong></p><p>I am firmly convinced that the accidents, meetings, unexpected opportunities, count more than anything in the construction of personal and professional background. Myself, I have known many turns due to meetings or events that I had not at all anticipated.</p><p>Today, I feel that many young people draw a specific and delineated career plan . But I think this is a mistake, is it cutting yourself from an entire universe of possibilities!<br />In fact, consulting is still a school for good students, with some continuity in careers and a common DNA. But precisely, there is a risk of formatting. If I had to give some advice to young people who get into this business, it would be to stay open, curious, and above all to be surprised; this is what will allow to avoid the pitfall of all beaten paths and methods, and to form its own key. Personality and creativity are the added value of the consultant!</p><p><strong>Are there any projects that have particularly marked your career?</strong></p><p>I think my first projects in the 2000s, with the boom of the Internet and telecommunications, have resolutely directed my career. Since then, I got specialized in this field.<br />I especially  like telecoms sector because it drove digital innovation, it must always be at the forefront. It is also a complex area because there is a high technology component. It demands to remain very flexible, dynamic, curious and, above all, creative.</p><p><strong>What do you like about</strong><strong> </strong><strong>consulting?</strong></p><p>What I like in consulting is mainly freedom, a freedom made possible by a flexible hierarchy, focused in project mode, because the point is to deliver the best solution to the customer in a short time.</p><p>Then what is exciting in this business is having to develop very different expertises and skills. I started my career in a company with a strong engineering DNA, and my sector &#8211; telecoms &#8211; is rather technical. So I had to learn fast this these technical subjects. But it goes in both ways! In turn engineers have to learn the business part.</p><p><strong>What balance do you find between your work life and your private life?</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s true that consulting is a consuming business in term of time. After 17 years of consulting, for my part, I would say that the secret to staying fresh and curious is to love what you do. Anyway, as we evolve in this business, we become known for a particular area, so we move towards an area that amuses us.<br />At this point, if we like what we do, we have the chance to tell things that fascinate us in the evening with family, and the two worlds feed each other.<br />I found my model, but there is no predefined model, you have to find your own. But if I had to give some advice, it would be never sacrifice your family or your personal desires and projects.</p><p><strong>Do you consider that the consultant is, in some way, involved in the &#8220;Life of the City&#8221;?</strong></p><p>Yes, there is a thought leadership aspect in consulting, it is a profession of influence. We advise policy makers, executives, and we produce important reports &#8230; It is even possible, as was my case, to have public institutions as client; then the consultant has a direct effect on public policy.<br />These consultant missions however belong to the professional world, which has its own rules, and I distinguish it from citizen engagement, which is more a personal sphere.</p><p><strong>What has changed for</strong><strong> </strong><strong>consulting?</strong></p><p>Consulting is about 40 years in Europe. So I would say that the world of consulting has changed, of course, it grew, became industrialized, but neither more nor less than its customers. Consulting has changed with and for its customers. This is an industry that is structured, with big international players, strong growth, countries that open up in the world &#8230;</p><p>Each generation has experienced a mutation of its customers. The next 10 years will reach the major issue of digital. We must anticipate how big data will transform the way we practice consulting.</p><p>I think that new life involves a creative requirement, solutions must be created in collaboration with the client, while all methods used are no longer appropriate.</p><p>Another big issue, I think, is to strengthen the synergy between different types of expertise (management consulting, legal, technical &#8230;) and make them work together. We arrive in a general decompartmentalization era, who asked to remain curious, open, inventive and above all passionate.</p><p></p>",

If anything there seems to be MORE consultants than ever! In fact, the category includes many different species: you can be an IT consultant, a HR consultant, a strategy consultant&hellip;you name it: there&rsquo;s a consultant for everything. Every department in a company can have an army of consultants to help improve its processes.</p><p>The digital transformation of our economy doesn&rsquo;t seem to have affected consultants the way it&rsquo;s affected journalists of advertisers. Indeed, consultants sell targeted services to help companies make the most of their digital transition. So digital is a business opportunity!</p><p>But the world of consulting IS changing profoundly. The model developed by the big consulting firms of the 20th century is going through a crisis. Their pyramidal organisation&mdash;with junior consultants doing the bulk of the work&mdash;is increasingly under threat: companies are less willing to pay high prices for copy-paste work performed by inexperienced junior consultants , however brilliant they may be.</p><p>Indeed, the era of copy-paste consulting is largely over. Consulting firms designed powerful systems, models and grids to help companies optimize their processes and cut their costs. But now these companies expect customized consulting services instead. They demand experienced industry experts and creative advice.</p><p>As a result, the consulting offer is becoming more protean: there are now more consultants who work outside these firms, offer customized services that can&rsquo;t be replicated and work directly with the companies whose problems they aim to solve.</p><p>To understand today&rsquo;s transformations, let&rsquo;s first have a look at consulting&rsquo;s history: consultants came with managers.</p><h4>How did management come to be?</h4><p>The history of consulting is directly linked to that of management. You may think management has always been around. After all businesses have always been &ldquo;run&rdquo;, haven&rsquo;t they? But it&rsquo;s not the case: the managers were the owners. Professional management was born after the industrial revolution. The first American business school (the <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWharton_School_of_the_University_of_Pennsylvania\">Wharton School</a>) was created in 1881 and management became an academic subject after the 1930s only.</p><p>In the US, the construction of the <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHistory_of_rail_transport_in_the_United_States\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHistory_of_rail_transport_in_the_United_States\">railways</a> and the telegraph in the 1870s created mass markets that made management necessary. All of sudden, the entire country was the market. Production and distribution became a lot more professional. The US industry became dominant. In 1870, it represented 23% of the world&rsquo;s production ; in 1913, 36%! Gigantic empires grew: US Steel, General Electric, AT&amp;T, American Tobacco&hellip;</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*Qg4rJqlduPEFVyHZ4Rgy3w.png\" data-width=\"489\" data-height=\"382\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"57\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*Qg4rJqlduPEFVyHZ4Rgy3w.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*Qg4rJqlduPEFVyHZ4Rgy3w.png\" /></div></div></figure><p>The main question these new empires had to answer was: how do we grow to serve such a large market and keep control over the company at the same time? Professional managers emerged as the new class of professionals to help companies answer that novel question. Managers don&rsquo;t produce. Neither do they own the company. They are executives who serve as go-betweens to enable the growth of empires.</p><p>To advise and accompany them, these managers required the help of other professionals: the consultants.</p><h4>The emergence of consulting as an industry</h4><p>The history of consulting is closely related to the professionalization of management and the emergence of a new class of managers in large corporations. But there was one specific political decision that provided consultants with a unique opportunity to turn their business into a mass industry.</p><p>In 1890, the US Congress created our modern competition law when it passed the <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSherman_Antitrust_Act\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSherman_Antitrust_Act\">Sherman Act</a>. Sherman was a Senator from Ohio who believed that the growing power of monopolies had to be curtailed. The act that bears his name was the first of a series of acts and court decisions aimed at protecting consumers against the predatory behavior of all too powerful corporations. The 1911 <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStandard_Oil_Co._of_New_Jersey_v._United_States\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FStandard_Oil_Co._of_New_Jersey_v._United_States\">Standard Oil v. United States</a> Supreme Court decision would complete what Sherman had started: it would dismantle John D. Rockefeller&rsquo;s sprawling oil empire.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*YzbgIvdIQ5x7xyPxjXH_aA.png\" data-width=\"3256\" data-height=\"3400\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*YzbgIvdIQ5x7xyPxjXH_aA.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"72\" height=\"75\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*YzbgIvdIQ5x7xyPxjXH_aA.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*YzbgIvdIQ5x7xyPxjXH_aA.png\" /></div></div><figcaption>Senator John Sherman from Ohio</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The law attempts to prevent the artificial raising of prices by restriction of trade or supply. &ldquo;Innocent monopoly&rdquo;, or monopoly achieved solely by merit, is perfectly legal, but acts by a monopolist to artificially preserve that status, or nefarious dealings to create a monopoly, are not. The purpose of the Sherman Act is not to protect competitors from harm from legitimately successful businesses, nor to prevent businesses from gaining honest profits from consumers, but rather to preserve a competitive marketplace to protect consumers from abuses.&rdquo; (Wikipedia)</p></blockquote><p>As price fixing and market manipulation became a lot less easy, companies actually had to compete with one another, i.e. to produce better products and more efficiently than the competition. There was the unique opportunity for consultants, who were best positioned to help companies improve their processes and become more competitive. This was the beginning of a symbiotic relationship between managers and consultants.</p><p>Process thinking became an art. Consultants could <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBusiness_process_reengineering\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBusiness_process_reengineering\"><em>reengineer</em></a> a company&rsquo;s processes, i.e. redefine and restructure its processes to make it more efficient, streamline its production to minimize costs and bring products to market in a more timely manner. Management consulting became a well-respected technical profession.</p><p>The era of <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstor.org%2Fstable%2F3114162%3Fseq%3D1%23page_scan_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jstor.org%2Fstable%2F3114162%3Fseq%3D1%23page_scan_tab_contents\">managerial capitalism</a> had begun. In the 20th century mass economy, efficiency was key. It was the result of the alliance between managers and consultants. Managers also needed consultants to legitimize their decisions.</p><p>Consultants created powerful tools to help streamline companies. These tools were transferable and replicable. For example, McKinsey&rsquo;s General Online Survey was created to serve as a clear roadmap for the young consultants who joined the firm. Its role cannot be underestimated.</p><p>Management became an academic subject. New schools were created to train managers and consultants. Harvard Business was created in the 1930s.<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPeter_Drucker\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPeter_Drucker\">Peter Drucker</a>, born in Austria, was the founding father of management as an academic field.

It dates back from the 1960s.

After the 1970s competition became increasingly fierce. Strategy became fundamental for all companies in a state of permanent war. Strategy applied taylorism to the company in its entirety&hellip; to make it as efficient as it could possibly be so it could crush its competition.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*I6M_Dv-W-6Vi9igKLpbRig.png\" data-width=\"182\" data-height=\"277\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"50\" height=\"75\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*I6M_Dv-W-6Vi9igKLpbRig.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/600/1*I6M_Dv-W-6Vi9igKLpbRig.png\" /></div></div><figcaption></figcaption><figcaption>Bruce Henderson</figcaption></figure><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBruce_Henderson\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBruce_Henderson\">Bruce Henderson</a> can be said to be the inventor of strategy consulting when he created the Boston Consulting Group in 1963.

The replicable models that made the fortune of these firms are called into question: companies want customized services and experienced consultants. Therefore smaller firms and independent consultants have multiplied.</p><p>Today&rsquo;s big consulting firms aren&rsquo;t quite as attractive as they used to be. They find it a bit harder to recruit the talents they need. The lack of work-life balance that comes with working for such firms is increasingly under fire. Some are now offering better work conditions in an attempt to make the profession more attractive again. But they have to compete with Silicon Valley companies for talent. Many graduates are now lured by Google and the like.</p><p>The new corporate giants produced by the digital revolution are &ldquo;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2FSB10001424053111903480904576513250915629460\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2FSB10001424053111903480904576513250915629460\"><em>eating the world</em></a>&rdquo;.

The <a href=\"https://medium.com/want-more-work/platforms-an-amazing-opportunity-for-the-creative-class-950ae343b80f#.qslp5ia3x\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/want-more-work/platforms-an-amazing-opportunity-for-the-creative-class-950ae343b80f#.qslp5ia3x\">phenomenon</a> doesn&rsquo;t only affect consulting, of course. Work relations are transformed everywhere. Platforms like <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhourlynerd.com%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhourlynerd.com%2F\">HourlyNerd</a> or <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclarity.fm%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fclarity.fm%2F\">Clarity</a>have spread. They match experienced professionals with problems that companies want to solve. Consulting may one day cease to be a profession. Scattered individuals with a diverse set of backgrounds and experiences will be able to provide a diverse set of skills, know-how and expertise to tackle various corporate problems. Companies can already find them on such platforms.</p><p>The pyramidal structure of big consulting firms is no longer a viable model: these firms require an army of junior consultants to do the bulk of the work. Senior consultants are a minority in that model. But because companies are reluctant to pay for junior consultants, the whole business model of consulting firms in under threat.</p><p><strong>2. The data revolution makes consultants somewhat obsolete</strong></p><p>In the past few years companies have hired thousands upon thousands of data scientists in the hope that they will help them make sense of the vast amounts of data they&rsquo;ve accumulated and base their strategic decisions on actual data.</p><p>Big corporations that have vast amounts of siloed data choose to pay for the services of software companies that can help them leverage their data. Palantir is a case in point. Have traditional consultants not been made a bit obsolete by engineers who can do more to help make companies &ldquo;data-driven&rdquo;?</p><p><strong>3. Innovation is not really in a consultant&rsquo;s DNA</strong></p><p>Our mass economy is coming to an end. We&rsquo;re living though a paradigm shift. Optimizing processes and cutting costs is not enough to face new disruptive innovators. And that&rsquo;s what consultants have been trained to do.</p><p>Corporations need radical innovation, not cost-cutting effectiveness. So big firm consulting may no longer be the right answer&hellip;</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Consulting is undergoing profound transformations. The archetypical big firm consultant is under threat. Big consulting is coming to an end.</p><p>Yet consulting is not dead! There will be more and more independent consultants. Many experienced managers and experts may become consultant AFTER several other experiences. Many others will be slashers and do consulting on the side.</p><p>The best days of consultants are yet to come. But they will not work the same way anymore.</p>",

        "content": "<p></p><p>MAY 31, 2016 – Travis Bradberry – entrepreneur.com</p><p>There are so many things that can kill the careers of good, hard-working people. Honest mistakes often carry hard-hitting consequences.</p><p>We usually only hear about the more egregious examples, such as when Yelp employee Talia Jane became an Internet sensation last month for writing a blistering post criticizing the company’s low pay and its CEO. To no one’s surprise, she quickly found herself out of a job.</p><p>Most people don’t go down in a blaze of glory like Talia Jane; they kill their careers in subtle, decidedly undramatic ways. And it’s a shame because it happens all the time.</p><p>A recent survey by VitalSmarts found that 83 percent of people had seen someone make a blunder that had catastrophic results for their career, reputation, or business, and 69 percent admitted that they themselves had done something that had damaged their careers:</p><ul><li>31 percent said it cost them a promotion, a raise, or even a job</li><li>27 percent said it damaged a working relationship</li><li>11 percent said it destroyed their reputation</li></ul><p>These numbers show how damaging you can be to your own career if you’re not careful. There doesn’t have to be a single, sickening moment when you realize that you just shoved your foot firmly in your mouth, either. Little things can add up over time and undermine your career just as much as (or more than) one huge lapse in judgment. The good news is that if you stay aware of them, these are all things that you can control before they creep up on you and kill your career.</p><h2><strong>1. Over-promising and under-delivering.</strong></h2><p>It’s tempting to promise the moon to your colleagues and your clients, especially when you’re honest and hardworking and believe that you can do it. The problem is that there’s no point in creating additional pressure that can make you look bad. If you promise to do something ridiculously fast and you miss the deadline by a little bit, you’ll likely think that you did a good job because you still delivered quickly. But the moment you promise something to someone, they expect nothing less. You end up looking terrible when you fall short, which is a shame, because you could have done the same quality work in the same amount of time with great results if you’d just set up realistic expectations from the beginning. This is one of those situations where perception matters more than reality. Don’t deliberately undershoot your goals; just be realistic about the results you can deliver so that you’re certain to create expectations that you will blow out of the water.</p><h2><strong>2. Complacency.</strong></h2><p>How long has it been since you proactively learned a new skill, reached out to your networking contacts, or even polished up your resume? If you can’t remember, you might have become a bit complacent, and complacency is a real career killer. It’s what happens when you’re just along for the ride and assume that nothing will ever change. But we’ve seen enough disruption &#8213; technological and otherwise &#8213; over the last few years to realize that change is inevitable. If you’re always too busy to learn something new or to expand your network, you’ve got your priorities mixed up. However, if you make continuous growth and development a priority, you’ll be ready for whatever comes your way.</p><h2><strong>3. Fear of change.</strong></h2><p>Fear of <a href=\"http://www.talentsmart.com/products/\" target=\"_blank\">change</a> is complacency’s evil twin. It actively works to keep things the same. I’m sure you’ve seen this one first hand at work when someone uttered the dreaded words, “But we’ve always done it this way.” Things are changing too fast these days to latch on so tightly to the status quo, and the costs of doing so can be huge. In one survey, 91 percent of respondents said that the most successful employees are the ones who can adapt to the changing workplace. Change is a constant part of our lives, both personally and professionally. It doesn’t matter whether you think things should change or whether you prefer the old ways &#8213; change just is. You don’t have to learn to love it, but you do have to learn to stop resisting it and to start adapting to it.</p><p></p><h2><strong>4. Having an inflatable ego</strong><strong>.</strong></h2><p>Did you ever work with someone who had a string of successes and started thinking that they were the be-all and end-all of superstardom? Success is great. It definitely boosts your career, and it feels really, really good. The problems start once you let it go to your head. You start thinking that success is going to last forever and that you’re entitled to it. Never, ever be content with resting on your laurels. Once you start thinking that you’re the cat’s meow, you’re setting yourself up for very painful failure.</p><h2><strong>5. Losing sight of the big picture. </strong></h2><p>It’s easy to become head-down busy, working so hard on what’s right in front of you that you lose sight of the big picture. But smart people learn how to keep this in check by weighing their daily priorities against a carefully calculated goal. It’s not that they don’t care about small-scale work; they just have the discipline and perspective to adjust their course as necessary. Life is all about the big picture, and when you lose sight of it, everything suffers.</p><div></div><h2><strong>6. Negativity.</strong></h2><p>Sometimes when you’re feeling negative and down, your mood can leak out and affect other people, even if you don’t intend it to. You were hired to make your boss’s and your team’s jobs easier, not harder. People who spread negativity through their department and complain about the work or other people complicate things for everyone else. If people always have to tiptoe around you so as not to dislodge that massive chip on your shoulder, they are unlikely to be willing to do it for very long.</p><p></p><h2><strong>7. Low <a href=\"http://www.talentsmart.com/about/emotional-intelligence.php\" target=\"_blank\">emotional intelligence</a> (EQ).</strong></h2><p>Everyone knows that you can get fired for being unable or unwilling to play nicely with others, but what trips up a lot of people is having a poorly developed poker face. If everyone can tell when you’re bored or irritated or that you think something a colleague says is stupid, this will catch up with you. Emotional outbursts, belittling others, shutting co-workers down when they speak, low self-awareness, and just generally being difficult are other ways that a lack of emotional intelligence will do great harm to your career.</p><h2><strong>8. Sucking up to your boss.</strong></h2><p>Some people suck up to their boss and call it managing up, but that isn’t the case at all. Sucking up has nothing to do with a real relationship built on respect; it is sneaky and underhanded. Suck-ups try to get ahead by stroking the boss’s ego instead of earning his or her favor. That doesn’t go over well with colleagues who are trying to make it on merit. Yes, you want to bolster your relationship with your boss, but not by undermining your colleagues. That’s the key distinction here. For a boss-employee relationship to work, it has to be based on authenticity. There’s no substitute for merit.</p><h2><strong>9. Playing politics.</strong></h2><p>Working hard to build strong work relationships is very different from instigating conflict, choosing sides, undermining colleagues, spreading rumors, and all of the other things that fall under the umbrella of “playing politics.” Again, it comes down to authenticity. If you find yourself sneaking around or if you’re embarrassed if some of your behind-the-scenes manipulations come to light, that’s politics. Stick to strategies you’d be proud to discuss in front of your colleagues.</p><h3>Bringing It All Together</h3><p>A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that they can only damage their careers by making one huge misstep, but the reality is that it’s usually not that dramatic.</p>",

Purchasing, for example, is moving to automated bots, with 15%–20% of total spend already sourced through e-platforms. By 2020 customers will manage 85% of their relationship with an enterprise without interacting with a human. Leading companies are experimenting with what these technologies can do for them, typically around transactional processes at early stages of the customer journey.</p><p>For example, AI applications can take over the time-consuming tasks of initiating contact with a sales lead and then qualifying, following up, and sustaining the lead. Amelia, the “cognitive agent” developed by IPsoft, can parse natural language to understand customers’ questions, handling up to 27,000 conversations simultaneously and in multiple languages. And because “she” is connected to all the relevant systems, Amelia delivers results faster than a human operator. Of course, there will be occasions when even AI is stumped, but Amelia is smart enough to recognize when to involve a human agent.<br />As we learned from researching our book, Sales Growth, companies that have pioneered the use of AI in sales rave about the impact, which includes an increase in leads and appointments of more than 50%, cost reductions of 40%–60%, and call time reductions of 60%–70%. Add to that the value created by having human reps spend more of their time closing deals, and the appeal of AI grows even more.</p><p>Clearly, AI is bringing big changes. But what do they mean for sales — and the people who do it? We see two big implications.</p><h4>The Sales Role Is Going to Change Completely</h4><p>The “death of a salesman” is an overplayed trope, but the road ahead does mean significant changes for how sales work is done. The changes are primarily focused on automating activities rather than individual jobs, but the scale of those changes is likely to profoundly disrupt what sales people do.</p><p>We analyzed McKinsey Global Institute data on the “automatability” of 2,000 different workplace activities, comparing job requirements to the current capabilities of leading-edge technology. We found that 40% of time spent on sales work activities can be automated by adapting current technologies. If the technologies that process and understand natural language reach the median level of human performance, this number will rise to 47%.</p><p>Pity the parts salesperson, an occupation where 85% of all activities have the potential to be automated with today’s technology. Gathering customer or product information to determine customer needs, processing sales or other transactions, taking product orders from customers, and preparing sales or other contracts collectively account for approximately three-quarters of a parts salesperson’s time — and all can be automated. On the other hand, most of a sales manager’s activities, which involve strategic decision making and employee supervision and coaching, cannot be automated.</p><h4>Sales People Will Need to Develop “Machine Intelligence”</h4><p>Much of the focus on AI and automation has been on which jobs or tasks will be replaced. That’s understandable, of course. But it’s clear, if less explored, that sales leaders and reps will continue to be crucial to the sales process even as they adapt to working with machines.</p><p>The “human touch” will need to focus more on managing exceptions, tolerating ambiguity, using judgment, shaping the strategies and questions that machines will help enable and answer, and managing an increasingly complex web of relationships with employees, vendors, partners, and customers.</p><p>Machine learning and automation tools, for example, will be able to source, qualify, and execute far more sales opportunities than reps can keep up with. Sales leaders therefore need to develop clear escalation and exception protocols to manage the trickiest or most valuable situations, making sure a sales rep keeps a robot from losing a big sale.<br />While machine learning will continue to evolve, for the foreseeable future senior executives must point the technology in the right direction. They’ll have to think about a number of questions: What sorts of decisions should be automated? Which kinds of automation will help deliver on strategic growth goals? What are the legal and risk implications? How will vendor and technology relationships need to be managed and integrated to create the greatest competitive advantage?</p><p>There are implications too for the hiring and managing of sales reps. An empathetic personality will still be important, but beyond their relationship skills, reps will succeed based on their ability to understand and interpret data, work effectively with AI, and move quickly on opportunities. That’s a very different sales profile from the one many companies recruit for today.</p><p>Machines are already doing many sales jobs more effectively and efficiently than their human counterparts, and boosting customer satisfaction in the process. How sales leaders respond will determine what the future of sales looks like — and how well it works.</p>",

        "content": "<p></p><p><em>Grant Thornton Executive is led by a group of executives that have gained a solid operational experience and expertise with multiple businesses and sectors: The circle of Senior Advisors. They accompany the leaders of on all the complex issues encountered by companies for which specific expertise is required: transformation, strategic reorientation.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>How was Grant Thornton executive born?</strong></p><p>In 2006, Grant Thornton acquired an independent firm, which was essentially proposing financial services. For my part, I was recruited in 2007 to join this structure, to integrate it into Grant Thornton’s consulting deals and to evolve its business model. From 2007 to 2013 we were only performing finance missions, then we decided to expand and we accompanied officers in senior management.</p><p>Between 2013 and 2014, we have recruited freelance executives, CEO or ex-CEO, which now constitute the circle of senior advisors. They are now nearly 80 and they are all operational managers who had never done consulting before. They are freelancers, and they open their address books to bring business.</p><p>We also have about thirty senior consultants available.</p><p></p><p><strong>And what does Grant Thornton Executive do now?</strong></p><p>We have several different offers:</p><p>&#8211; A diagnosis in organization and structuring, related to digital processing for companies.</p><p>-A 48h flash diagnosis to enable start-ups to achieve strong growth.</p><p>-A Diagnostic check up transmission, in 24 hours, to raise the leader to the transmission.</p><p>We also have operational support offers in part-time or full time. A third of missions concern the general direction, a third concerns financial directions, a third concerns more diverse missions such communication or events.</p><p>What motivates the customer to choose these deals is that we put at his service at least two profiles: an operational leader and a consultant. The message is transmitted better from leader to leader.</p><p></p><p><strong>Unlike most consulting firms, they are not professional consultants, does this mean that anyone can do consulting?</strong></p><p>They are not professional consultants, but you still have to take them to an external posture. If left in a leadership position, the diagnosis is very negative or brittle. The consultant has an operational vision, but in the way of telling things and accompanying, he has more diplomacy and gentleness. The goal is to bring these executives to this posture of consulting</p><p>For start-ups, for example, we know that everything is not stringent, one must have a smooth. Some of these executives are not made for consulting. But the strength of the system is that the executives are never alone. They are always accompanied by a professional consultant.</p><p>In reality, we created an internal management committee. We do not sell a person who does everything, a superman. We sell the strength of a collective.</p><p></p><p><strong>If you prefer the experience of operational managers, so you use mostly people over 45 years?</strong></p><p>I work all generations, from 40 years to 70. I also work unemployed people, and especially I put them in relation with employed people. To link employed and unemployed people, it also brings career repositioning.</p><p></p><p><strong>How do you recruit your executives?</strong></p><p>Initially, the circle was born with my former bosses, 13 leaders who saw a potential interest in what I was trying to build. So there is a relationship and a very strong identity. If a person is not suitable, it will be rejected by the group because the others will not want to work with him.</p><p>To be recruited, a new member is co-opted, he then passes interviews, then he must be approved by a selection committee. As it is a network that works well, people come to us most often.</p><p>Actually, I first associated skills, a network, before creating the offer. If I had created the offer before and been searching people then, the collaborative dynamic would not have worked.</p><p>In fact it is the personal initiatives that bring business. Each person brings his experience and contacts, and provides a potential turnover to the group.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is it therefore a collaborative platform with a horizontal management?</strong></p><p>Exactly, to drive a collaborative platform, it is important not to put middle-managers. As they are executives of more than 50 years, they want to keep their freedom, they would leave if they were too framed. The feeling of belonging to a community is also very important, it must be maintained with events to unite the group.</p><p>But as this is consulting, there still are certain obligations to hold, reporting for example.</p><p></p><p><strong>Why are these executives freelance?</strong></p><p>This is a question of market. Usually consulting companies have few senior associates to raise margin rates. There we only have senior associates. It is therefore not possible to hire them.</p><p>For the employment of seniors from 40 to 70 years, it is a market where we can no longer provide a full-time employment. So if they are freelancers, either they work with temporary work agencies or with consulting firms. In Grant Thornton Executive, they are freelancers who are integrated into a collective. They lose 45% of the sale price, but they have a steady workflow and a network.</p><p>Grant Thornton Executive’s strength is its strong brand identity. Allowing it to withstand the digital platforms.</p>",

        "content": "<p><em>Cedric Allix, after a career in retail, luxury and consulting, founded his company, BTW Advisors, and works as a freelance consultant to support retailers in their Digital Transformation and Start-ups in their business development.</em></p><p></p><p>September 23, 2016&#8211; Adrien Cools&#8211; Editorial Team</p><p></p><p><strong>What was your career pathway?</strong></p><p>I have been working in Retailing for 23 years, first in DIY at Bricorama and in business consulting for the retail at Deloitte Consulting, Ineum Consulting and BearingPoint. In early 2008, I joined Fast Retailing as Europe CIO, which includes several brands such as Uniqlo, Comptoir des Cotonniers, Princesse Tam Tam, I helped build the European shared Service Center to support Brands’ development in Europe. After that I worked at Channel as Europe CIO (Fashion, Watches &amp; Fine Jewellery and Fragrance &amp; Cosmetics). Then in 2015, I decided to create my own business, BTW Advisors. Now I am a freelance consultant and I help start-ups to grow in retailing and retailer in their digital transformation.</p><p>So there is in my career a consistent line in term of business sector, but I had the chance to take very different roles, it is rather due to the opportunities I could seize at the right moment, it really helped to develop myself as an individual.</p><p>Today, I realized that in large companies, I was bored, I&#8217;m too old to “work in a box“, simply apply what they ask me to do, without being able to give my opinion on the global view and not authorized to go outside the box, and to young to wait for my retirement, above all I was thirsty for entrepreneurship.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you think there is an evolution in the relation people have to their career, compared to twenty years ago?</strong></p><p>Twenty years ago, I do not think I could have made that choice to become entrepreneur. Over the years, I have acquired professional experience that justifies me in the consulting market and retailing.</p><p>But there is also now a fundamental movement. Employees can no longer satisfy themselves of large traditional companies, because ultimately the human factor and personal development is not so important to them. People know that “classic groups” are hiring people to do a specific job, and that for any good or bad reason, (when the job is achieved or governance has changed) they can decide to fire someone without any problem. And they take someone else.</p><p>Things are starting to change, people have become aware of the reality of companies and have a desire for emancipation. Companies need a precise skill at a precise time, but individuals don’t want to do the same thing all the time, they want change! Innovation is so fast and with new technologies, everyone can have the opportunity to create his own business. This eco-system did not exist 10-15 years ago. Increasingly, first in the USA, but also in France, a big part of the experimented labor force now works as freelancers.</p><p></p><p><strong>Start-ups, you work with, do you think they are going to become the same large traditional companies or is there a real change of nature?</strong></p><p></p><p>No, the start-up spirit is a fundamental movement. Start-ups which became big companies like Google or Facebook, their mode remains one of the start-up, everything can move fast, no process is fixed. Companies operate in project mode, and hierarchy is less important, what matters are individuals who will work on the project. The principle of the Hackathon, for example, illustrates this idea; there is always a dynamic of independence and innovation at the heart of the company, which puts individuals at the center.</p><p>But this model aims to extend and generalize. Retailing, where I work, counts many large traditional companies, but they are very interested in the start-up model, and want to integrate this operating mode.</p><p>The rise of freelancers and start-ups is part of the same dynamic. This is to put individuals and their knowledge, experience at the center of the business.</p><p></p><p><strong>What balance do you find between work and private life?</strong></p><p>As a freelancer, it&#8217;s a real challenge because the two can mix easily. Even physically, because I work at home, but it&#8217;s also nice because I can work when I want, where I want depending on my customers’ priorities. But it is true that it is more difficult to put a border between work and private life. I allow myself time when I disconnect completely. But it&#8217;s a new rhythm I&#8217;m still learning.</p><p></p><p><strong>How do you think consulting is going to evolve?</strong></p><p>Consulting was born with individuals who have created cooperatives to jointly provide their services to companies, then these entities got structured in large machines, with processes and calibrated hierarchies.</p><p>But now, two major changes are observed. First of all, customers no longer ask the consultants to think or to manage project or perform tasks as employees (body shopping), but they have more practical needs related to digital with a higher added value, which require more specific expertise. Consulting firms must therefore appeal to other actors such as start-ups.</p><p>Then the individuals themselves sought independence and talented consultants, quite often, become freelancers. Consulting firms therefore have to seek these independents.</p><p>For consulting firms, it is even more difficult to recruit young people because they aspire to move, create their business and do not want to work in large companies.</p><p>Inevitably, the consulting profession is evolving. The question is whether the consulting firms will be able to adopt a new long-term vision and adapt to this change.</p><p>Even if the Brand of a consulting firm can still be a real value for its customers, new players appear, platforms for example, a new form of business consulting. By nature, these platforms represent a new desire for freedom and a new power of knowledge and competencies, which are shared. These actors are potential competitors for consulting firms.</p><p></p><p><strong>For young people who have less experience, is it possible to work directly as freelancers without beginning in a big company?</strong></p><p>I am working with a start-up that allows young people to carry out freelance assignments. Young people love to manage their time as they wish. Today it has entered the culture, and businesses use them regardless of skill level.</p><p>I feel that Freelance is a global aspiration, people do not want to get into boxes, they want to manage their time, they prefer to work in project mode, and it is also more comfortable from a financial point of view.</p><p>If you begin to work as freelancer or entrepreneur, you need to have big idea and motivation, or deep skills in what you want to do. This schema offers many opportunities to grow but also many occasion to fail. Failure has now to be considered as a part of the learning experience.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you have any advice for someone who wants to work as a freelancer?</strong></p><p>Of course, I advise to DARE, as Obama’s moto says: yes we can! Trust in yourself! Your future is in your hands.</p><p>We all have special talents; everyone has to find out about what he is good at or what pleases him. Outside France, it is more fluid, young people travel after high school, to multiply experiences rather than go into a mold.</p><p>In France, there is currently a tension about the status of work, but it is not the majority. I’m convinced that most of people want more flexibility, more freedom, but due to politics and culture, they are still afraid. There is in France a real dynamic, many initiatives and opportunities. But we must also avoid the pitfall of self-censorship.</p>",

In the UK, for example, the median age is 40.5&mdash;which means more than half the population today is older than 40. It is nearly 38 in the US, 41 in France, and 46 in Germany. An increasingly high share of our global wealth is expected to be generated by older workers whose contribution is vital to the sustainability of our social protection systems.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*ucv3hbMvz6LY4jaA4ZNVbQ.png\" data-width=\"610\" data-height=\"425\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"50\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*ucv3hbMvz6LY4jaA4ZNVbQ.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*ucv3hbMvz6LY4jaA4ZNVbQ.png\" /></div></div></figure><p>One might expect ageism to decrease as our societies get older. How can one possibly discriminate against almost everybody?</p><p>It&rsquo;s a paradox but the more our societies age, the more our culture tends to worship youth and its attributes of beauty and strength. There are strong differences, of course, between the German culture where the elderly are a more visible part of the country&rsquo;s social and economic fabric, and the French one, where the elderly are only expected to remain visible so long as they show no visible sign of ageing.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*1yBB3RTqCVA43Ds0bBTxag.png\" data-width=\"1380\" data-height=\"690\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*1yBB3RTqCVA43Ds0bBTxag.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"40\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*1yBB3RTqCVA43Ds0bBTxag.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*1yBB3RTqCVA43Ds0bBTxag.png\" /></div></div></figure><p>Subtle&mdash;and not so subtle&mdash; discrimination on the basis of age pushes workers over 45 who hope to join a company to go to great lengths to try and hide their true age.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whether the jobs were for administrative, sales, security positions or janitors, the rates of callbacks &mdash; either by telephone or by email &mdash; were much higher for the younger workers than the older ones.

Many strive to become more efficient and cut costs whenever possible. Naturally payroll is a critical lever when one aims to cut costs. &ldquo;Senior&rdquo; workers are significantly more expensive so it&rsquo;s just more rational to hire younger workers who can often do the same job for a lot less.</p><p>Mass economy corporations have developed detailed processes in an attempt to make most workers easily replaceable. In that context, there is no need for the experience or &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; of older workers. Because they are often protected by unions, it&rsquo;s not always easy to make them redundant, so the only solution is to make all new hires among the young.</p><p>In the world of consulting, the whole business model of big consulting firms rests on their age and seniority pyramid: the bulk of the work must be performed by young consultants who use models, grids and tools designed to be replicated. The pyramid requires that most of these consultants leave their firms after a couple of years. Turnover is vital.

Platformization doesn&rsquo;t only affect consulting, of course. Work relations are transformed everywhere. But they are about to change consulting forever.

Companies can already find them on such platforms.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;New platforms have emerged that offer to connect qualified workers directly with the companies (or people) whose problems need to be solved. For example, HourlyNerd is a Boston-based global online marketplace that connects big and small companies with over 20,000 independent business consultants for project-based work. Clients post projects, receive bids, select experts and make payment on the platform.

Thus companies will not have to hire them but can buy their services when they need them, transform fixed payroll costs into variable costs, and benefit from experienced expensive talent without paying the high price of having them on the payroll. The workers, meanwhile, will be able to choose the projects they want to work on, negotiate the prices they see fit, and maintain good enough revenues in the process.</p></div></div></section><section><div><hr /></div><div><div><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>All in all, the pyramidal structure of big consulting firms is no longer a viable model: because companies are reluctant to pay for junior consultants, the whole business model is now under threat. Consulting is undergoing profound transformations. The archetypical big firm consultant is no longer the same. Big consulting is coming to an end.</p><p>Yet consulting is not dead! There will be more and more independent consultants. Many experienced managers and experts may become consultants AFTER other experiences to give their clients the benefit of their experience and insight.

        "content": "<p>JUNE 14, 2016 – Carolyn O&#8217;Hara – HBR</p><p>Working in the family business can be fraught. When your manager is also your parent, sibling, or another relative, how do you keep things professional? Do you ask to be treated the same way as others, or accept that you will have a different sort of relationship at the office? Do you publicly call your mother “mom,” or your father “dad”? And what about getting candid feedback for your own growth and development?</p><p><strong>What the Experts Say</strong><br />People who successfully work with family often say there is nothing more fulfilling or enriching, says Claudio Fernández-Aráoz, a senior adviser at the global executive search firm Egon Zehnder and an <a href=\"https://hbr.org/video/4660653966001/4-lessons-from-the-best-family-businesses\" target=\"_blank\">expert on family businesses</a>. These people “consistently speak of a much greater sense of purpose and meaning in their lives,” he says. But if something goes wrong, the damage can be devastating. Fallouts with family over work can cause a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/04/what-to-do-if-a-feud-threatens-your-family-business\" target=\"_blank\">tremendous amount of anger, sadness, and shame</a>, says Rob Lachenauer, CEO and cofounder of <a href=\"http://banyan.global/\" target=\"_blank\">Banyan Family Business Advisors</a>. “When ordinary people get fired, they get another job,” he says. “When a family member gets fired, they feel they’ve been fired from what they were born to be.” Here’s how to effectively work alongside relatives.</p><p><strong>Work somewhere else first</strong><br />Experience in an outside firm should be a requirement before embarking on your career in the family business, says Lachenauer. You’ll get invaluable training, improve your business judgment, and build your confidence. You’ll also gain much-needed perspective on what you hope the arc of your career might look like. Starting off elsewhere is critical “not just because of what you will learn in terms of capabilities,” says Fernández-Aráoz, “but fundamentally, in getting to know yourself” and understanding “what you want to do as you get older.”</p><p><strong>Create separate spheres immediately</strong><br />On day one when you return to the family business, <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/03/dealing-with-the-unique-work-life-challenges-of-family-businesses\" target=\"_blank\">set a boundary between family time and work time</a>. Letting the two bleed into one another is a recipe for conflict, says Lachenauer. You don’t want to talk about clients at Sunday dinner, or about family drama at the office. “Thinking physically is very useful,” he says. “When you are in the office, you are business people. When you are on the ranch, you are family.” Create house rules about which family matters are permissible to talk about at the office and vice versa. It can be helpful to note which hat you’re wearing before embarking on a conversation. For example, you can preface a discussion by saying, “I’m talking to you as your son right now, not your employee.” If you feel your family member isn’t respecting these boundaries, “bring it up privately and immediately,” says Lachenauer.</p><p><strong>Define your role and career path</strong><br />Make sure you have a crystal-clear understanding of your job description and that others know what role you fill. That way you’ll avoid needlessly stepping on colleagues’ toes or giving anyone the impression that you’re resting on your laurels. Be transparent and proactive about your expectations and goals for the future, especially if you would like to hold the top job in the future. “Succession between generations is a very risky project,” says Fernández-Aráoz, which is why it’s critical to talk early and openly about rules for advancement and what handing off power might look like. “Recognize you may get more opportunities than others,” Lachenauer says. “Acknowledge that, and then work your butt off.”</p><p><strong>Adopt an office voice</strong><br />Pay attention to the details of your interactions with family. “Language matters tremendously,” says Lachenauer. Actively listen and use a professional tone with one another — that way you don’t make others feel excluded by your closeness or cause unnecessary squabbles when boundaries are breached. Lachenauer recommends you not call each other by nicknames at work, as it “can signal to other employees that the family relationship takes precedence.” But strike the balance that feels right for you. “You don’t want to behave artificially,” says Fernández-Aráoz. If calling your mom by her first name feels too awkward, for example, don’t strain to do it, but consider using her given name when discussing her decisions with colleagues.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Seek independent feedback</strong><br />Getting candid input when you’re the boss’s son or daughter can be difficult, if not impossible. “Assume you won’t get good feedback,” Lachenauer advises. He suggests participating in the standard review process but always supplementing it with outside evaluations to ensure that you learn and grow on the job. “Ask for 360 reviews or employ a coach,” he says. The key is to be proactive, adds Fernández-Aráoz. “You cannot wait for top-down guidance.” One smart strategy is to tap an independent board member to evaluate your progress and performance so you can get smart career advice and reviews.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Have a backup plan</strong><br />When your professional and personal lives are intertwined, your own identity can be overtaken by the daily demands of family and work. For your sanity and future success, it’s critical to maintain outside interests and contacts of your own. That might mean dedicating time to professional networking and enrichment groups so that you keep up with business contacts and develop new skills. It might also mean carving out time for personal hobbies or taking vacations without the extended family, so you have some breathing room away from the business. And as much as it might pain you to consider, think regularly about a Plan B, in the event the family business — or your place in it — hits tough times. “Have an exit plan,” says Lachenauer. “Then it won’t be the end of the world if it happens.”</p><p><strong>Principles to Remember</strong></p><p><strong>Do:</strong></p><ul><li>Get experience at an outside company first to improve your judgment and boost your confidence.</li><li>Be proactive about asking for candid feedback from someone outside your family.</li><li>Have a Plan B.</li></ul><p><strong>Don’t:</strong></p><ul><li>Bring family nicknames into the office. Maintain a professional tone whenever possible.</li><li>Completely meld work and family. Keep the two worlds separate.</li><li>Let yourself be coddled. It always ends badly.</li></ul><p><strong>Case Study #1: Work elsewhere before climbing the family ladder</strong><br />Toby Bozzutto’s father, Tom, never asked him if he wanted to work in the family real estate management company. But after a few disillusioning years in the music business, Toby wanted to do just that. Tom was surprised at the request but agreed on three conditions: “I had to go work for someone else first,” says Toby. “I had to get a master’s degree in real estate development. And I had to start at the bottom.”</p><p>Toby did everything his father asked, joining The Bozzuto Group in 2001 as a development associate. He eventually headed up the company’s development business before becoming the company’s president in 2013. “I was tremendously concerned that people would think I was entitled or only there because of nepotism, and subconsciously it made me work twice as hard,” he says.</p><p>Tom and Toby made sure to stay focused on business while at the office. “I didn’t have a direct line to him, and he didn’t seek me out,” says Toby. “It was exceedingly rare that we talked about our family life at work, and if we did, we did it away from everyone else.”</p><p>Early on, they also attended a weeklong seminar at Harvard University that focused on leadership transitions. “One of the things we learned was that I should never report to my father,” says Toby, “and that I should be treated the same as anyone else.”</p><p>“When you begin to work with your family, the trajectory of your relationship changes,” he adds. “For us, it has been so rewarding and enriching. But it’s hard because business is so deeply intertwined with the personal.”</p><p>Toby says he’d be thrilled if any of his three children express an interest in joining the business. But until then, “I’m going to mimic my dad and never bring it up.”</p><p><strong>Case Study #2: Set clear expectations from day one</strong><br />When it was clear that Teddy Winthrop was growing dissatisfied with his career at an executive search firm, his brother Bayard offered him some advice. “He told me to figure out what I was passionate about, to start learning about business, and to become interesting to people who might want to hire me,” Teddy recalls.</p><p>This prompted something of an epiphany. Bayard had recently launched American Giant, a U.S. manufacturer of high-quality hooded sweatshirts sold directly to consumers. Teddy admired the organization’s mission and reinvention of the retail supply chain, so he went back to his brother and told him, “I want to work for you.” After mulling it over for a week, Bayard agreed to hire Teddy as an operations coordinator in the rapidly growing startup.</p><p>“From the beginning, I was concerned about favoritism,” Teddy says. But Bayard made it clear that Teddy would be receiving no special treatment. Teddy explains that on his first day of work, the two sat down together to set clear expectations: “Bayard said, ‘As your brother, I want you to learn from this experience. As your boss, I expect you to run through walls for me.’ The separation of the worlds was there from the beginning.”</p><p>Bayard also told Teddy’s supervisor to give him very direct feedback. “That honesty allowed me to excel,” says Teddy. “I knew when I was doing a good and bad job.” He also benefited from monthly evaluations where he would rate his own performance and colleagues would offer anonymous feedback.</p><p>The experience Teddy gained at American Giant proved invaluable when he decided to strike out on his own with a new idea. In 2015 Teddy launched his own company, Edward Field, which also sells American-made products: innovative wallets that hold smartphones. He credits Bayard’s no-nonsense leadership and advice with helping to inspire him.</p><p>“Setting expectations early is one of the most important things when working with family,” he says. “Separating work from home is key so you can have a healthy perspective.”</p>",

These teams give Fortune 500 executives what appears to be super-human knowledge.</p><p>Fortunately for those of us who don’t have Fortune 500 budgets at our disposal, it’s getting easier and easier to build your own secret support staff. Within five years, most executives at any size company — and, indeed, most knowledge workers — will have tools that do much of the work of a CEO’s private coterie.</p><p>The reason? Machine intelligence.</p><p>“Cyborg systems,” or what I called “agents” in my <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/26/machine-intelligence-in-the-real-world/\">survey of machine intelligence startups</a>, will make this possible, using a blend of learning algorithms and distributed labor to perform an ever-widening range of tasks at low cost. With help from these agents, we’ll be able to look as smart as those CEOs do today.</p><p>We’ll also become more productive. Most knowledge workers spend less than half of their time doing things they’re really good at (i.e., what they’ve been hired to do). The rest is spent doing research, arranging meetings, coordinating with other people, and performing other minutia of office life.</p><p>These tasks could be done just as well by a machine intelligence service. For example, a typical knowledge worker might use:</p><ul><li>Scheduling and calendar coordination through agents like <a href=\"https://claralabs.com/\">Clara</a> and <a href=\"https://x.ai/\">x.ai</a></li><li>Keeping on schedule through proactive alerts like those delivered by Google Now, Siri, and Cortana</li><li>Organizing tools for regular meetings, mimicking a “Chief of staff” with a Slackbot that provides status information and facilitates meetings, like <a href=\"http://howdy.ai/\">Howdy</a>*, <a href=\"http://www.sofetch.io/products/standup-bot-open-source/\">Standup Bot</a>, <a href=\"https://tatsu.io/\">Tatsu</a>, and <a href=\"https://geekbot.io/\">Geekbot</a></li><li>Following up after meetings, with minutes complete with highlighted keywords, offered by tools like <a href=\"https://www.gridspace.com/\">Gridspace Sift</a>* and <a href=\"https://pogo.ai/\">Pogo</a>*</li><li>Indexing for written notes with handwriting recognition, like in Google Docs or Evernote</li><li>Improving writing with text-analyzing tools like <a href=\"https://textio.com/\">Textio</a>* or IBM’s Watson Tone Analyzer.</li></ul><p>(Asterisks indicate portfolio companies of Bloomberg Beta, where I am a partner.)</p><p>In cases where machine intelligence can’t yet suffice on its own, on-demand service providers like Uber, Lyft, Grubhub, and Blue Apron will give people the ability to order time-saving perks like private drivers and delivered lunches at a relatively low cost.</p><p>I got one taste of this when I started using <a href=\"http://www.askwonder.com/\">Wonder</a>*. Wonder is like having a personal researcher. They deploy a small army of experts, including trained librarians, to do small, defined research projects for me. If I want a dossier on someone I’m meeting later in the week, the lowdown on a company’s product, or a sketch of the competitive landscape for a company, I ask Wonder. For $30 to $60, Wonder saves me hours every week.</p><p>More and more products and services will fuse machine intelligence with crowd work to help users get things done. Uber is a good example: it combines on-demand drivers with algorithmic scheduling and coordination to deliver rides.</p><p>To be clear, CEO support teams aren’t going away. Top executives will continue to see benefits from dedicated, trusted support staff who can handle difficult, urgent, delicate work. But machine intelligence systems can take on elements of what these people do at a much lower cost, democratizing many of these capabilities.</p><p>Granted, there is going to be a lot of garbage before we realize the full promise of these virtual support armies. Just look at the profusion of chatbots coming on the market today. Some work very well for simple tasks. But many of them fail to live up to even basic promises, like this <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/facebook-messenger-chatbots-are-more-frustrating-than-h-1770732045\">weather bot that has trouble telling you about the weather.</a></p><p>Not every machine intelligence application will work; others will prove to be merely novelties. But if you can filter through the many new offerings to find valuable tools, your work will improve and you may even start to look like those CEOs with the seemingly superhuman abilities that I admired when I was starting out.</p>",

We work in all areas of coaching, for example balance sheets of career and skills.</p><p></p><p><strong>Youth is often idealized right now, especially with the start-up spirit of Silicon Valley, how do you explain the rejection of seniors?</strong></p><p>It is true that companies are often affected by ageism. In France for example, the companies and headhunters often reject older applicants. But I think it&#8217;s all about posture. We help many seniors, and those who manage to reposition themselves are those who have a young attitude, positive, those who do not have allergy to new technologies and new management methods, such as horizontal management.These are also people who are able to invest in associations, to speak. The idea is to work in project mode &#8230; Those were easier to reposition themselves. I have several examples of people over 55 who easily find a job.</p><p></p><p><strong>What interests for a company to hire people of more than 45 years?</strong></p><p>The advantage is that they are often people who can be operational quickly, have a capacity to take more distance. They also have agility and adaptability.</p><p></p><p><strong>Have you also seen people cut out for entrepreneurship, freelance? Is this a rising trend?</strong></p><p>It is true that there are many people who have a desire for entrepreneurship, but in reality there are also people who do it by default, they think they will never find a job because they are 55, so they will do freelance consulting. Either by founding a structure either by portage. But there are also people who have a real desire for entrepreneurship, and want to use their talents to start their own business.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you think older people have a growing desire for freedom?</strong></p><p>Yes, but there is the desire and the economic reality. It&#8217;s true that to do entrepreneurship or freelance there are a lot of skills to develop, such as business development for example. You should also understand customer problems. There is a whole new mindset to develop, and it is not always easy.</p><p></p><p><strong>Companies are reluctant to the idea of hiring seniors because they are more expensive. But do you think that freelance will allow seniors to showcase their expertise and become an alternative to classic jobs?</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s true that this is an interesting solution for companies, it helps to have expertise with high added value, while maintaining flexibility. As for freelancers, the challenge is to have a flow of missions big enough to make a living. I do not know if this is the case. There may still be an evolution to expect the companies’ side</p><p>But today, even more than the expertise and skills, it is the posture, the adaptability, that counts. That is to say that we must focus on the soft skills.</p>",

        "content": "<p>JUNE 23rd, 2016</p><p><em>We met Yann Varin, 30 years, who both worked in consulting and founded a start-up. His pathway proves there are bridges between these fields.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>What is your career pathway ?</strong></p><p>I first studied theoretical physics at the ENS Cachan (ed. : a prestigious public institution of higher education and research founded in 1913,<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"> </span>one of the major French Grandes Écoles, which are considered the pinnacle of French higher education.), but I did not want to become a researcher or a teacher. Then I began to work in strategic consulting at Mars &amp; Co. It is a very challenging job, that enables the development of analytical skills.</p><p>Then I wanted to do entrepreneurship, so I launched a digital start-up with a partner. It was a media and a social network on running, a mass sport. It also interested me much to work on digital issues. We quickly grew an important traffic on our network, but, on the Internet, once you made a quality traffic, the challenge is to find a way to monetize it. We finally didn’t find the business model of our start-up, so we sold it.</p><p></p><p><strong>Did strategy consulting make you want to start entrepreneurship?</strong></p><p>No, to do entrepreneurship, you must first have the desire to do it. But the skills developed in strategy consulting are very effective in many areas, such as customer approach. Being an entrepreneur is different, it’s less framed, you have to do all jobs… The analytical skills you develop in strategic consulting are formative, but then the ability to do entrepreneurship corresponds more to certain types of profiles and personalities.</p><p>But you can also go back from a start-up to strategy consulting. It gives a double expertise, combining strategy consulting skills after your studies and a field experience in a start-up to better understand customer issues.</p><p>So it is quite possible to go from theoretical physics to strategy consulting, then go in a start-up, and finally return to strategy consulting. That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you think your experience of entrepreneurship will serve you in consulting? Are you going to work as a consultant differently?</strong></p><p>Yes, having been at the heart of a start-up, sometimes in difficulties, will be useful to better understand customers’ problems. In addition, the experience of start-up is increasingly valued in consulting, French Tech is fashionable. Many consultants would like to spend time in a start-up, and then return to consulting with this new expertise. Conversely, many start-ups recruit consultants for their analytical capabilities.</p><p></p><p><strong>Therefore gateways between different fields are more important?</strong></p><p>Yes, and they are becoming more accessible, it is very complementary and more valued by recruitment firms and consulting. Experience in a start-up, for example, is more valued than an experience in an internal strategy department, because it is partitioned and limited to an industry and a profession. Working in a start-up can help develop a resourcefulness and get out of complicated situations more easily.</p><p></p><p><strong>How do you think consulting will be in the future? Do you think this business will evolve?</strong></p><p>Consulting is changing ; historically, it was a traditional and hierarchical business. But the big players reach critical size, for example McKinsey recruits experts, such as UX designers and data scientists. They like to have more in-house experts, so they are diversifying the profiles.</p><p>On one side consultancies therefore modernized. But on the other side there are also more and more people who want to enhance their expertise, but retaining flexibility. So there is also a community of freelancers which is growing, they are older people, seniors who want to enhance their great experience, but also young people who want more freedom.</p><p></p><p><strong>What do you think of this platformization movement? Can it reach consulting?</strong></p><p>Like any platform, it requires a match between supply and demand, so there is no difficulty for the supply in my opinion. On the freelance side there is a desire, it grows. But on the client side there is still a critical size to achieve to make it work. This market must be educated, so that customers have confidence.</p><p></p><p><strong>One more thing to add?</strong></p><p>I have an unusual career, with a theoretical scientific training, and it allowed me to work in several areas. It is good that France is beginning to break down barriers and to develop more diverse skills. It is already the case in USA. I have a career that shows it is possible to enhance the diversity of profiles within an organization.</p>",

        "content": "<p>You just have to open your eyes to see that work is changing, and changing fast. Evidenced by the growing success of concepts such as lean development, iteration, horizontality, empowerment, learning organization, open innovation, and many others all inspired by the start-up spirit.</p><p>Companies have already turned the corner and they are now applying these new models. If education and teaching usually lag behind, we can currently observe new initiatives aiming to revolutionize our education models. This development foreshadows an essential adaptation to labor market upheaval.</p><p>These Schools 2.0, such as <a href=\"https://www.42.us.org/our-philosophy/goals/\">School 42</a>, <a href=\"https://www.lewagon.com/\">Le Wagon</a>, the <a href=\"http://stevejobsschool.world/\">SteveJobs Schools</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theschooloflife.com/london/\">The School of Life</a>, are anticipating the fragmentation of 21st century&rsquo;s labour market, marked by the rise of creative economy, which requires to develop different abilities, and a different relationship to knowledge.</p><p>As a matter of fact, our traditional education systems are no longer adapted. According to the latest <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/education/equations-and-inequalities-9789264258495-en.htm\">PISA survey in 2013</a>, which includes 39 countries, the level differences are more important within states than between states; these gaps are directly correlated with social origin, but also with the rigidity and compartmentalization of education systems: <em>The less stratified education systems &ndash; that is to say those who are less likely to divide students between institution , tracks and grades according to their abilities or behavior &ndash; are characterized by greater equity in terms of learning opportunities and performance.</em></p><p>France, for example, sees his school&rsquo;s performance deteriorate &ndash; one person in five does not master the basic skills &ndash; and inequality of its system to widen. As for employability, the youth unemployment rate is 24% in 2016.</p><p>That is the conclusion that <a href=\"http://www.institutmontaigne.org/fr/publications/le-numerique-pour-reussir-des-lecole-primaire\">the report of the Montaigne Institute on the digital school</a> (published in 2016) points out to call that teaching accomplish its digital revolution.</p><p>According to the Montaigne Institute, the digital education allows both to individualize instruction, use big data to improve system performance and foster creativity and autonomy through the &ldquo;learning by doing&rdquo;.</p><p>But, above all, the digital evolutions threaten school of obsolescence by making knowledge immediately accessible. Thus, according to A. Collins and R. Halverson, <em>if the school can not incorporate new technology in the meaning of the school itself, so long identification of schooling and education, developed over the last 150 years, will dissolve in a world where the richest students will go for education outside of public schools.</em></p><p>The dynamic is already underway, with the &ldquo;home schooling&rdquo; emerging trend in the US, which questions the relationship of our societies with traditional educational models. A study by the National Home Education Research Institute (Nheri), published in 2011, argues that almost 2.3 million young Americans follow a home schooling program, an increase of 75% in 14 years. Similarly, the emergence and success of the Khan Academy, founded 9 years ago, with 20 million users &ndash; which offers a new source of education, accessible to all, for all ages and free &ndash; questions the capacity of our education systems to evolve in a short time.</p><p>Digital economy, and opening it brings in the diffusion of knowledge therefore pushes schools to reinvent themselves, change their point of view and their function. This ideal of 2.0 school may find its fulfillment in the <a href=\"https://www.42.us.org/our-philosophy/goals/\">School 42</a>, founded in 2013 by Xavier Niel and Nicolas Sadirac, and dedicated to computer programming.</p><p>When questioned, Nicolas Sadirac emphasizes creativity as key value: <em>You should know that our educational system originally comes from the military education.</em> <em>In the industrial era, it was perfect, well suited, to make the machine running we needed disciplined workers.</em> <em>But today, the digital promotes creative economy.</em> <em>As the current system reduces creativity by disciplining, it is cons-productive.</em> <em>We need creative people, and for that we must change the education system!</em></p><p>School 42 thus works on the principle of student autonomy. There are no teachers and teamwork prevails. Nicolas Sadirac told us: <em>Here at 42, we have a purely empirical educational process.</em> <em>The conclusion is that IT is constantly evolving;</em> <em>you can learn a language at school and you realize that it doesn&rsquo;t exist anymore when you are out.</em> <em>The obsolescence of knowledge will go quicker, and above all it will spread to other areas.</em> <em>If it is useless to teach knowledge, then we need students who learn alone!</em></p><p><em>When you teach something to someone, in fact he is prevented from finding it alone!</em> <em>In addition, young people are changing, but the system does not move.</em> <em>Today, students can check directly on the internet what the teacher says.</em> <em>Furthermore, at home, with internet and video games, children do creative and complex things, they create universes and drive communities.</em> <em>In comparison, the school is a far more retrograde universe!</em></p><p><em>The idea is precisely to see education as a video game.</em> <em>At 42, students have a project to do, they have to build a team for the project, then the project is rated by other students.</em> <em>There is also a system of quests and challenges that may be posed by other students.</em> <em>After each mission completed, the student gains experience and has access to other levels, degrees or medals.</em> <em>This collaborative logic is applied to everything, even to life in community and school </em><em>administration</em><em>, with collective tasks.</em></p><p><em>Working in groups is precisely the most difficult, in the beginning you have chaos.</em> <em>But the idea is to create a problem that people are going to solve collectively, self-organizing.</em> <em>For example, when several groups work on a part of a global project, they eventually realize they have to communicate and work together to succeed.</em> <em>The objective is to promote the development of each individual from the collective.</em></p><p><em>In reality, this collective capacity to innovate, it especially comes from diversity, both in curriculum, age and social background.</em> <em>We require very different people to pool everything to blend their skills.</em> <em>Then they question themselves and they create very disruptive things.</em></p><p><em>This is why 42 is free and does not select on diplomas or school records.</em> <em>To enter, students must pass the test of the &ldquo;swimming pool&ldquo;, an obstacle course on a month to test the ability to work in teams and to find solutions, and especially motivation.</em> <em>The problem with the current education system is that it is only suitable for a small proportion of people, and we believe that those who do not conform to this system are idiots.</em> <em>To find new talents, we must first expand the selection criteria.</em></p><p><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/15149394-2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/15149394-2.png 965w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/15149394-2-300x145.png 300w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/15149394-2-768x371.png 768w\" alt=\"15149394 2\" width=\"714\" height=\"345\" /></p><h5>Currently set in Paris, a new School 42 will open in Fremont, California.</h5><p>Thus, there are very different profiles at 42, for example, a few years ago, Mr Noah&rsquo;s hands were more familiar with the contours of a rifle than a keyboard: the 28-year-old had joined the military after leaving school at 16, concluding that all his civilian options had run dry. For its part, Before joining 42, Ms Zouari worked in retail and in a bar. She left school at 17, unhappy with France&rsquo;s traditional school system, which she found too rigid: I like to learn but not what they want me to learn,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;French teachers don&rsquo;t seem to like what they do and they shout at you. As for Arnaud, who says that he was heading straight for a job at McDonald&rsquo;s before he chanced upon 42 in 2013. Today, he feels confident about his future and already has a part-time IT post thanks to what he has learnt at 42. <em>I feel I can get a job any time because this place has taught me to do things by myself</em>, he said.</p><p>42, this crazy project of school without teachers, proves that the digital revolution makes possible a major disruption in the approach to education. A new system based on the winning trio: autonomy, collaboration and decompartmentalization. All qualities that are becoming essential in the 21st <sup>century </sup>, the era of creative economies.</p><p>Proof that this model does not apply only to geeks: the SteveJobs Schools in the Netherlands, set up by the foundation O4NT (Onderwijs voor een nieuwe tijd, or &ldquo;Education for a New Era&rdquo; in English). These seven schools cater for children from 4 to 13 years. For these darlings, no more blackboards, chalk, formal classes, lesson plans, seating charts and even the parent-teacher conferences, but IPads!</p><p>Unlike traditional schools, kids can just show up at any time between 7:30 AM and 6:30 PM on any workday, and are only required to be on-site during the core period between 10:30 AM and 3:00 PM. The building is open all day long so the kids can join each other in all sorts of activities at any time. The school gives flexibility also to the parents who can organize the child&rsquo;s vacation and school hours on their schedules. Thus, the children can keep up with their schoolwork from anywhere.</p><p>Both learning methods and educational content differ widely from what the traditional schools offer. Although most of the activities are done with the help of the iPad, this is not just a virtual school. Children can physically come together and join each other for educational activities, games, sports, arts and social interaction.</p><p><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/steve_jobs_school_holland_002-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/steve_jobs_school_holland_002-2.jpg 990w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/steve_jobs_school_holland_002-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/steve_jobs_school_holland_002-2-768x513.jpg 768w\" alt=\"steve_jobs_school_holland_002 2\" width=\"704\" height=\"469\" /></p><h5>Studying in a SteveJobs School</h5><p>The traditional classes have been replaced by groups of children aged 4-7 and 8-13. Students can choose to study whatever happens to interest them. This will be done at their own pace and style, in a game-like experience. In each exercise, the children are corrected the way players are in a computer game. There are no grade levels in Steve Jobs schools, only evaluations every 6 weeks. While in the physical school building, children will move around various &lsquo;subject rooms&rsquo; according to their individual schedule.</p><p>What about teachers? According to O4NT&rsquo;s press release: <em>In the O4NT approach, teachers will no longer simply convey knowledge to a group of children; they will be transformed into coaches that support children with their individual and group projects</em>.</p><p>The general idea is to get the child to develop the qualities flagship of the 21st <sup>century:</sup>the ability to process information, collaborate and work as a team, especially critical thinking, able to solve problems and creativity.</p><p>You left the school bench for a long time but you&rsquo;d like, you too, to catch up the movement? Do not worry, many training and bootcamps appeared to allow you to tune up your skills according to your desires and needs in a short time. Le Wagon for example, created in 2013, is an intensive training camp to learn computer programming in 9 weeks. This is largely to provide the necessary autonomy in this area for people who want to do entrepreneurship. According to its founder, Romain Paillard, digital culture radically influences the way of appraising learning and even his own career:</p><p><em>What is exciting with programming is that it already has in its DNA a disruptive load.</em> <em>The developer is spearheading the freelance model, professional nomadism: a computer and wifi and that&rsquo;s enough!</em> <em>The collaborative economy, lean development, iteration, open source were invented by the community of programmers.</em></p><p><em>Putting myself in code, I had to unlearn all my lawyer reflexes to integrate programming reflexes.</em> <em>In a word, it taught me to make short and effective.</em> <em>This encoder thought structure can bring a very innovative and essential breath to the old model of education.</em></p><p><em>To simplify, there are now two macro elements in learning: first a cultural, educational and societal corpus, that must be seen as a necessary foundation for all learning, it may be middle and high school.</em> <em>Then grafted onto this base you have large vertical trunks, very general knowledge units that are considered indivisible.</em> <em>Now it is well known that a student who comes from a university or school will not use in his professional life more than 10% of what he learned, I know something about that with my 8 years of law studies!</em></p><p><em>The idea is to graft on the base, instead of large units, a variety of small, concrete and directly applicable programs.</em> <em>The shortened format of 9 weeks, hyper intensive, should indeed perfectly suit to teach only the 10% of knowledge that will actually requested in the professional world.</em> <em>This new model of education is actually better suited to the slashers era we are entering.</em></p><p><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13076937-2.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13076937-2.jpg 1100w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13076937-2-300x200.jpg 300w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13076937-2-768x513.jpg 768w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/13076937-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w\" alt=\"Le Wagon: Ecole de code et de developpement de projet web et de Start-up - El&egrave;ves Photographi&eacute;s en train de coder dasn les locaux de l'espace de Co-Working &quot;The Family&quot; - 7 Novembre 2014 - Paris\" width=\"742\" height=\"495\" /></p><h5>Programming Session at Le Wagon</h5><p>To maximize the time at best and deliver a condensed and effective training, Le Wagon had to develop a well rehearsed teaching methodology. According to Romain: <em>We evolved this learning process iteratively and organically.</em> <em>It was first organized in small workshops of a day or two, at good prices, just to know if people were willing to pay for this service.</em> <em>As soon as there was an interest, we started our 9-week sessions, modeled on the US format.</em> <em>Students have a common learning platform, but it has changed a lot, all the teachers and students make their own contribution.</em> <em>Every city, every class is a unit of experience that will bring improvement to the whole.</em></p><p><em>Our methodology is now very structured but it always evolves constantly.</em> <em>It went very quickly, after a year we already had in Brussels.</em> <em>Our training is always timed and calibrated to be more effective.</em> <em>We can, for example, predict exactly what day we will have to do a retake for students in difficulty.</em></p><p>On the model of computer languages, the technical expertise in all areas now operates more quickly. There is therefore a need to stay in constant learning. That is why there is a fragmentation of trainings, with a multitude of small, short, intensive programs to customize your skills according to your business needs. This new model of training, in reality, simply accompanies the fragmentation of the labor market, where there are an increasing proportion of freelancers. In this new world, the challenge is no longer to have a large stock of knowledge, but to develop an ability to quickly integrate new models, adapt to it, to question them and even create new ones.</p>",

        "content": "<p>MAY 17, 2016 – ADAM TOREN</p><p>Ah, the Holy Grail for every entrepreneur: a perfect work-family balance. Equilibrium between the two is often fleeting, but work and family time <em>can</em><em> </em>coexist in peace. Leverage these five essential strategies to help you juggle &#8220;bringing home the bacon&#8221; with those you share it with.</p><h3><strong>1. Build family time into your schedule.</strong></h3><p>You typically work 9 to 5, but where does family time fall on your agenda?  Too many entrepreneurs wait until the work is done to hang out with family, but you should run your schedule, not the other way around.</p><p>Failing to schedule family time means it will be the first thing to fall off the table when life gets busy. As you piece together your calendar for the next week, consider how much time you&#8217;d like to spend with family on a regular basis. Don’t just write in the events you’ll look bad for skipping (AKA your spouse’s birthday bash or your kid’s dance recital); include casual, unspecified family time, too. Your loved ones will appreciate the extra dignity, and you&#8217;ll never override family time with work time again.</p><p></p><h3><strong>2. Create a routine.</strong></h3><p>Leaving work early on Fridays or Skype calling the kiddos every day at lunch may help you to achieve that work-family balance. <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-13/features/sc-fam-0911-routine-blessing-20130911_1_habits-cues-and-rewards-charles-duhigg\" target=\"_blank\">Social psychologist Wendy Wood</a> of USC says healthy habits (oft used by some of the world&#8217;s most successful figures) are key to reducing stress and deliberation. In this case, it lets family members know what to expect out of each day and puts them at ease, too.</p><p>You don&#8217;t want to take this step alone. Instead, sit down with family and take note of everyone&#8217;s needs, then build a reliable routine. If you&#8217;ll be taking the kids to school in the mornings and your spouse will be picking them up, write it down. The bonus? If you succeed at this step, you&#8217;ll be able to skip the one above.</p><h3><strong>3. Learn to say “no.”</strong></h3><p>Slow down, eager beaver; you don’t have to accept every project proposal or favor asked of you. Ambition is a wonderful thing, but not at the expense of yourself or your family.</p><p>Here, moderation is key: you&#8217;ll want to learn to only bite off as much as you can chew.  Can you become the occasional mentor to a friend’s startup instead of their number-one, in-house advisor? Are you able to chauffeur just one of your kid’s field trips and still create the ultimate bonding experience? By narrowing down responsibilities outside of family, you&#8217;ll have more free time to spend with those you love.</p><h3><strong>4. Work smarter, not harder.</strong></h3><p>What if I told you there were hours’ worth of family time hidden throughout your workweek? It’s true &#8213; and uncovering them will make every family member smile.</p><p>Outsourcing basic tasks frees up a good chunk of time, making it easier to accomplish the things you truly want to do. Are you responsible for tasks that can be outsourced? Sites like <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiverr.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Fiverr</a> make it easier to achieve a work-family balance by shifting impersonal duties to a virtual assistant. In contrast, platforms like <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.taskrabbit.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">TaskRabbit</a> allow you to assign activities like housekeeping and grocery shopping to a pre-screened &#8220;tasker.&#8221; Designating tasks to others opens your schedule and helps to conserve energy for fun time with family.</p><h3><strong>5. Schedule time for yourself.</strong></h3><p>Adding yet another thing to your calendar can only subtract from family time, right? Nope. <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.psychologytoday.com%2Fblog%2Fhigh-octane-women%2F201301%2F6-reasons-you-should-spend-more-time-alone\" target=\"_blank\">Studies show</a> that spending a little “me time” now and then can help to increase general life satisfaction and boost productivity once you get back to work. It also helps to enhance concentration, which allows you to better &#8220;enjoy the moment&#8221; when you&#8217;re out with family. Rather than zoning out during a movie with the kids (or even falling asleep), you’ll be more attentive and aware, which is far more satisfying for you and your loved ones.</p><p>Take this as an explicit permission to enjoy the solo activities you love without guilt. Go ahead: reserve a window for a spa visit, a few laps in the pool, a cozy hour with your favorite novel, or whatever else makes you happy. Then soak in the wonderful feeling of being 100 percent present in anything that follows.</p><p>A comfortable work-family balance isn’t impossible to achieve. Though life happens and the scale will occasionally tip, it’s entirely realistic to create a balance that satisfies both you and your loved ones.</p>",

        "title": "Hackathons Aren’t Just for Coders",
        "content": "<p>APRIL 01, 2016 – Elizabeth Spaulding – Greg Caimi – HBR</p><p>Facebook recently hosted its 50th hackathon. It was <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3056018/exclusive-inside-facebooks-ai-hackathon\" target=\"_blank\">the stuff of Silicon Valley lore</a>: Employees from across the company took a break from their regular projects to develop mind-blowing ideas about artificial intelligence over an intense 24-hour period. Late-night thinkers enjoyed a 1AM meal to refuel.</p><p>Inevitably, not all of the final pitches were winners but, to Facebook, the potential for uncovering groundbreaking innovations is worth pulling a couple hundred engineers away from their everyday tasks. After all, its past hackathons have given rise to wildly popular features, such as its instant messaging feature Facebook Chat and Instagram’s time-lapse tool Hyperlapse.</p><p>Hackathons are no longer just for coders. Companies far outside the tech world are using these intense brainstorming and development sessions to stir up new ideas on everything from culture change to supply chain management. For example, we recently helped a leading financial services company hold a small hackathon with 18 employees. The company wanted to make its banking services more enticing to millennials. We divided the company’s participants into five teams and collaborated with experts from the Stanford d.school to teach the basics of customer-centric design and rapid prototyping over three days.</p><p>The teams spent part of each day talking to consumers on the street. This exercise revealed an important insight: Millennials didn’t find switching banks onerous if they liked a bank’s products. Rather than devising ways to make switching banks easier, we realized the company needed to sharpen its product offerings. Armed with this information, the company developed prototypes for new tools that aim to help millennials avoid financial pitfalls and manage their money better.</p><p>At their best, hackathons create a structure and process around idea development. Sure, breaking out of the day-to-day routine can reinvigorate and inspire staff, but hackathons also demonstrate to employees that innovation is not only welcomed but also expected. Well-run hackathons lead to concrete ideas for new products and processes that can improve the customer experience and increase growth.</p><p>Just about any company can hold a productive hackathon by following these five steps:</p><p><strong>Stoke the creative mindset.</strong> Hackathons require participants to step out of their normal roles and skill sets. This may mean interacting with different colleagues or performing unfamiliar creative tasks. A short team activity can help participants loosen up, think boldly and open their minds to their colleagues’ ideas. It can be as simple as challenging teams to brainstorm uses for an oddly shaped object.</p><p>An apparel manufacturer kicked off its hackathon with the telephone game, the one where a spoken phrase inevitably gets distorted as a series of players whisper it to each other. After collecting enough hilarious answers, the hackathon leaders shared them throughout the exercise to keep participants’ energy up.</p><p><strong>Empathize with customers and get personal.</strong> A promising idea starts with a deep understanding of a specific set of end users — who they are, what they need and why. The best companies augment traditional surveys and segmentation tactics with old-fashioned conversations with current and potential customers and frontline employees.</p><p>Low-tech discussions, like the brief interviews the financial services firm conducted, are more likely to reveal the true thoughts and feelings that influence consumer behaviors, even unique needs that customers aren’t fully aware of yet. They also offer an opportunity to talk to consumers who aren’t typical users of a product, which could result in a compelling idea that a survey would never yield.</p><p><strong>Ask the right question.</strong>The best hackathons start with an open-ended but clear challenge, such as: “How might we help our sales team interact with contacts more effectively?” The question should be aspirational, without prescribing a likely solution, and participants should have the freedom to think of as many ideas as possible — or even to rethink the challenge entirely if new information arises.</p><p>Executives at a luxury hotel chain that recently used a hackathon to devise ways to make its customer experience more personal found that employees felt inhibited by some of the company’s performance measures. These employees felt that they couldn’t use their best judgment to delight customers if it might compromise a rule. This critical insight allowed the company to redefine its central challenge during the hackathon and come up with more salient ideas.</p><div></div><p><strong>Prototype and test promising ideas quickly.</strong> After participants pick the one or two most promising ideas, teams can immediately start to plan out potential solutions. Prototyping could be as simple as drawing a product on paper while thinking through how a user might interact with it. It could also be a process or a set of operating norms that set the stage for bigger changes.</p><p>Savvy teams will test the evolving prototype on customers and incorporate their feedback. In the best cases, user feedback influences the design and provides the ultimate measure of success. At Facebook, they say “code wins arguments” when it comes to deciding what’s best for customers. In other words, if users don’t love a new feature, then the effort has failed.</p><p><strong>Nurture and expand the best ideas.</strong> The most skilled innovators put resources behind their strongest pitches and hone them further after the hackathon ends. They continue the testing and feedback process, and look for ways to turn these ideas into large-scale improvements that can help the company grow.</p><p>A large restaurant chain we worked with recently used a hackathon to revamp its dining experience. The exercise not only unlocked new ways to introduce menu items to customers, it inspired key elements planned in a major renovation of its dining space and bar.</p><p>While hackathons can help companies develop new products and services, the benefits reach far beyond the output of a single hackathon. We’ve seen companies use hackathons to promote cultures of innovation, to change the operating norms at the most senior levels of a company and to rally support around major initiatives.</p><p></p>",

        "content": "<p><em>After an international career of over ten years in fashion, between Dubai, Milan and Paris, where she was alternately Director Marketing and Sales Director for the finest luxury brands, Fanny Auger Founded The School of Life of Paris. The School of Life is dedicated to developing emotional intelligence with the help of culture.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>What is the origin of the concept of The School of Life?</strong></p><p>The concept comes from Alain de Botton, a famous philosopher. He wrote many books about culture and philosophy. For example <em>How Proust Can Change Your Life?</em> Or <em>How to think more about sex?</em>. So it&#8217;s a very deconsecrated and practical approach to philosophy.</p><p>He was delivering lectures, and people asked him very practical questions. The big questions of life, those posed by children, for which we think we have an answer, but not really. Alain de Botton realized there was no place where adults can expound intelligently about these things.</p><p>So he created this place, the School of Life, a school without easy answers, where we can explore together these questions. It is participatory, so people are asked to think by themselves. The goal is to take some distance to think about everyday things.</p><p>The teacher does not dictate his view, he invites to reflection. He also gives personal examples, which uninhibits people.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is the relationship between the School of Life of Paris and Alain de Botton?</strong></p><p>The School of Life is a franchise created by Alain de Botton, so I trained in London with him, there is a School of Life method. But The School of Life of Paris is independent, it is a French company and we have adapted all the lessons from London, we also have created others. There is a trusting relationship with Alain de Botton and he does not worry about what we do.</p><p>There are now a dozen of Schools of Life around the world: Melbourne, Sydney, Sao Paulo, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Berlin, Zurich, Tel Aviv. Seoul, Antwerp, and soon in Tai Pei.</p><p></p><p><strong>What you learn in the School, as the conversation, are faculties we learn naturally, so what need there is to acquire such skills through training?</strong></p><p>It is true that everyone is born with the ability to speak. We all do naturally. But the conversation is also about desire, openness, listening. So we have to take a step back from our habits.</p><p>When I started to give conversation classes, I thought that only timid people would come, but in fact extroverted people came. They say they always do the same show, they always repeat the same things and they end up going in circles, bored by themselves. The idea is to listen.</p><p>For example, when we say &#8220;How are you? &#8220;It makes no sense anymore, we do not even expect the answer, the idea is to give attention.</p><p>People are doing things mechanically, and the goal is to regain their attention to things.</p><p></p><p><strong>How do you teach something that in principle is learned by experience?</strong></p><p>The goal is mainly to create opportunities through culture. Our teachers adapt courses from London, and above all they talk about their own experience. It is especially important to integrate feedback from the people and have a sharing time. The teacher may not know better than the students, it is essential that people exchange among themselves and take a step back from their own practices. This is the power of collective intelligence.</p><p>But you must understand that we do not have easy answers. Recently, we made the course &#8220;how to make choices? &#8220;. This is a very interesting course, but there were many persons who came for the first time at the School of Life, without understanding the concept. We had several emails of complaint, because people came with an urgent topic, such as &#8220;Which flat should I choose to rent? &#8220;Or should I leave my husband? &#8220;And they thought that we would give them a direct answer. But they have to do the job by themselves, they are just given ways to feed a reflection.</p><p></p><p><strong>How to adapt an Anglo-Saxon approach to France?</strong></p><p>I was immediately impressed by the quality of the courses we get from London. So we usually keep the structure, but we adapt the cultural references, with more French references, more likely to touch our audience.</p><p>But there are also several courses that we have created ourselves.</p><p></p><p><strong>Today the labor market increasingly values soft skills. Is it possible to give directly to people the soft skills which are necessary for their work?</strong></p><p>It is true that the softs skills are increasingly important. In a course we give, we ask the question &#8220;what qualities are needed to do your job? &#8220;And all the listed qualities are soft skills.</p><p>But I do not think soft skills can be learned. We can awaken people, draw attention to experiences and open their mind. But you can not teach someone to be nicer or happier for example. It is not our ambition</p><p></p><p><strong>From a practical standpoint, how does the School of Life work?</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>We have a BtoC business model. We first recommend people to do only one course to see if they like it, 39€ (43$) the course, and they can also take packs.</p><p>This is not a very profitable business. I am often asked to open schools in other cities, but I will not be able to. Furthermore, we have a good press coverage, through a partnership with My Little Paris. But word of mouth works well.</p><p>We also work in companies. Usually people come to the School of Life and then speak about it in their company. So we do courses specialized for companies, for example Carrefour, LVMH, SNCF, My Little Paris, Vuitton, L&#8217;Oreal, Sephora&#8230;</p><p>People tell us that it has a real impact, they easily remember what they learn.</p><p></p><p><strong>How do you recruit your teachers?</strong></p><p>At first I did not know well the world of coaches. So I met nearly 200 coaches, but I have not recruited any. Coaching is often an expression of a midlife crisis. There are a lot of bad coaches on the market. There are also charlatans that claim to make you find happiness for example, then it is absurd, we do not pretend to make you find happiness.</p><p>So there is no typical profile for teachers, they are often slashers. It especially needs to be someone who is aligned with the concept of the School of Life.</p>",

For a financial services activity. We also have activities with asset management, private banking, and we began working on the digital economy, a new market we are developing.</p><p>The fact of working in project mode, with consultants who themselves have their own structures, is an Anglo-Saxon model, not very common in Paris.</p><p>We just do head hunting, worldwide, according to the needs of our customers.</p><p>If the client does not know where he will base his position, it is not a problem. We also work in transition management, but in this case we are working with more specialized people.</p><p></p><p><strong>You have a specialized activity on seniors. There is a rejection of senior today in the labor market, how do you explain it?</strong></p><p>Especially in France, with The Great Thirties, people were working 30 years in the same company, and did not necessarily have to train. But today, we are in a tough market, without changing our thinking. We did not consider that the experience can bring something.</p><p>The younger generations are not interested in long-term contract, they just want to come in a company for a project. So seniors have to reinvent themselves.</p><p>These are stressful situations that did not exist before.</p><p>In the UK and in the USA, there is a big market for freelancers, they are more in a project mode, there are fewer barriers between internal and external in the company.</p><p>The Anglo-Saxons have less known the welfare state than the French, so they have had to adapt, even the seniors. There are financial constraints which make them capable of accepting any job or even take two &#8230;</p><p></p><p><strong>Can freelance be a model of society?</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>There are many senior citizens who live just fine with freelance. When they get to understand that they have value, these people can find a quality of life only by doing missions, and many feel at ease.</p><p>Today, everything is project, we must have people that can adapt themselves. The advantage of the senior is that he will learn a lot by doing freelance. There are not enough people who take risks for the moment in France, so there is not enough jobs. Consulting firms always take the largest share of the market. But when we take a consultancy, we deprive ourselves of the experience of these freelance seniors. Yet they are quite capable of adapting to new technologies. The experience of the senior also gives it added value. Their experiences help for transformation projects for example.</p><p>But the challenge with freelancers is to be able to mobilize them to make them give the best of themselves. It demands open and modern human resources.</p><p></p><p><strong>As hunting firm, how do you position yourself in relation to the fragmentation and platformization of labor market?</strong></p><p>I&#8217;m not competing platforms, I use them. I am selling my skills, because the headhunter job, a platform can not do it. But with Linkedin I do not need a research assistant, and I work a lot faster.</p><p>The technology also allows me to be more free, and avoid many costs.</p><p>In principle, I do not find jobs for freelancers, but only long-term jobs. I am identified as a hunter. But I think this is where the future will be, so I&#8217;ll maybe reposition myself.</p><p>Freelance is the future. There is a part of the market where companies only want freelancers. The trend will be heavy, it is sociologically what will happen. So will have to adapt to it.</p><p>Hunting firms are evolving, they will find their place in the platform economy because they work in project mode, qualitatively.</p>",

Career strategy, development strategy, business strategy and even family strategy! Even holiday bookings are subject to a strategy.</p><p>Unfortunately, what is always forgotten in all your strategic plans is also the most important. But this is what allows you to perform, to keep up in your professional and personal lives, to be creative and responsive.</p><p>This forgotten thing is your health.</p><p>Have you ever once thought about developing a health strategy? A plan that would enable you to develop actions that allow you to be healthy not only at a moment but also in the coming years. A plan that ensures enough energy to complete your daily actions, your contingency and your side projects?</p><p>Why not start today?</p><p><strong>Consider his body as his planet</strong></p><p>As the Earth, your body gives you the resources to carry out your activities (professional and personal). As with Earth, you tend to consume your reserves without asking questions. We need the rain stops to make us aware that water is a finite and vulnerable resource essential to human survival. You need to throw you back to force you to stop and discover that you have a body. It leads you to the office every day and even more when it&rsquo;s well it also lets you thinking, focus, work, talk, &hellip; The pain wherever it is in your body inhibits any physical but also intellectual activity.</p><p>And if you adopt the principle of sustainable development in your body? Consider your body as the planet and meet its present needs without compromising future capabilities.</p><p>Your body is not a garbage can, first feed it emphasizing quality over quantity.</p><p>As it is living, moisturize it of course and give him some daylight ! Get out and walk, aerate yourself at least 30 minutes a day.</p><p>And above all it needs diversity! Mix pleasing activities, leisure and professional activities. A moment of pleasure is like a nap. It recharges your positive energy.</p><p><strong>Invest in yourself</strong></p><p>If you want to take with you other people, colleagues, family, friends in your life adventure, you have to be resistant and strong.</p><p>Investing in yourself means attach sufficient importance to yourself to be considered as a priority. And you are a priority. When you take time for yourself, you are neither selfish nor unconscious, you invest in your productivity.</p><p>Taking an hour of your time for physical activity, meditating, napping &hellip; is investing time in performance but also in creativity and good humor.</p><p>But the hardest part is still to find the time in question. The time is not extensible, it must be fitted out, much like a room you find too small. You can not push the walls in the room but you can fit out inside.</p><p>If you do not Set up a &ldquo;time for yourself&rdquo; in the agenda, it will never create. The agenda is like nature, it abhors vacuum.</p><p>Then each week should include a &ldquo;time for yourself&rdquo;, in preference to practice physical activity or relaxation.</p><p><strong>Be realistic</strong></p><p>If you want to optimize your performance, and persevere your energy, impose you to answer this question:</p><p>&ldquo;Would I dare to impose this agenda and this &laquo; to do list &raquo; that I assign myself to a colleague or friend?&rdquo;</p><p>Being realistic about your capabilities first means to optimize your chances to succeed and carry out what has been planned. Finalize a task is much more rewarding and motivating than finish each day with this feeling of incompleteness and dissatisfaction.</p><p>There is nothing more demotivating than dragging tasks from the day before and nothing more consuming in confidence and energy than to say you&rsquo;re lousy because you have not managed to do your job .</p><p>Being realistic allows you to respect yourself and be kind to yourself by not imposing excessive workloads. This also allows you to capitalize on what you succeed. The success is related to motivation, reward, recognition, personal satisfaction &hellip; Estimate the time and amount of manageable actions is a 100% winning strategy.</p><p>Because the state of mind in which you end each day will also determine your performance the next day.</p><p>Being self-satisfied at the end of a day and not exhausted, it means imparting a positive and active dynamic that will continue the next day and even over several days.</p><p>Be proud of yourself at the end of a day because you have achieved your goals is to start another day with the desire to battle with a new list!</p>",

        "content": "<p>MARCH 31, 2016 – Dorie Clark – HBR</p><p>Given the <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2016%2F03%2Factually-you-should-check-email-first-thing-in-the-morning\" target=\"_blank\">profusion of emails</a> every professional grapples with—on average, <a href=\"http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Email-Statistics-Report-2013-2016-Executive-Summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">more than 100 per day</a>—it’s become common wisdom that, at some point, you should stop emailing and just pick up the phone. Author James Altucher jokingly <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fjamesaltucher.quora.com%2FThe-Most-Amazing-Productivity-App\" target=\"_blank\">praised the telephone</a> as “an amazing tool/app that makes my work 100x more productive,” noting, “I’m not being sarcastic. It’s the truth.” But despite their merits—notably, being able to confer and resolve issues in real time—I studiously avoid almost all phone calls, and <em>never</em> accept an incoming call from someone unknown. I’m not alone. The number of voicemails left, and retrieved, has been <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2013-09-03/voicemail-decline/57556358/1\" target=\"_blank\">steadily declining</a>, major companies like J.P. Morgan and Coca-Cola are <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2015/06/10/413866432/businesses-are-hanging-up-on-voice-mail-to-dial-in-productivity\" target=\"_blank\">eliminating voicemail</a> for many employees, and Millennials in particular seem to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/neilhowe/2015/07/15/why-millennials-are-texting-more-and-talking-less/#5b5331835576\" target=\"_blank\">abhor phone calls</a>.</p><p>I eschew most calls for two main reasons. The most obvious is productivity, because it <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com%2F3017832%2Fbottom-line%2Fthe-sneaky-sucky-way-distraction-punctures-your-productivity\" target=\"_blank\">takes 23 minutes to recover</a> from a distraction at work—and almost nothing is more disruptive than an unplanned call taking you away from the task you intended to accomplish. Also, the minimum default timeslot for a call is usually 30 minutes, while even the most information-laden emails take 5-10 minutes to compose. By scheduling a call, you’re often drawing out and extending a process that can be completed in one-third the time (for instance, setting a meeting agenda may require a couple of emails back and forth, but each email will probably take less than 5 minutes to write—whereas your colleagues may well fill up an entire half-hour call prattling about those same logistical questions).</p><p>The second reason is that it can be hard to make good decisions in the moment if you’re surprised by a request. <em>Should you accept that speaking engagement? What price should you quote? Do you actually want to meet up for coffee?</em> You may need time to reflect—or get your wording straight if you want to decline—and the pressure of being on the line with someone may hinder your efforts. But avoiding phone calls is easier said than done, in a culture where “Let’s hop on a call” is still a standard default whenever you need to work out details for contracts, events, or anything else. Here are three ways I ruthlessly minimize all but the most essential phone interactions.</p><p><strong>Set aside specific blocks for call time</strong>. There will always be some phone calls that need to happen—and some may even be enjoyable, like “getting to know you” introductory calls with new colleagues in other cities. But to minimize the disruption to your schedule, create back-to-back scheduling blocks, so you can bundle your calls together—on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, for instance. You can use an online scheduling tool like <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scheduleonce.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">ScheduleOnce</a> or <a href=\"http://www.timetrade.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TimeTrade</a>which allows you to identify your chosen blocks and send it to colleagues so they can book slots directly, minimizing the back-and-forth.</p><p><strong>Postpone and delay</strong>. Some people may respond poorly if you decline a call altogether. But you can minimize the pain, and perhaps avoid the obligation entirely, if you delay it. Instead of immediately agreeing to a call, make a plea for greater efficiency. “I’d love to talk with you more about the event,” you could write. “Before scheduling a call, to make sure it’s as efficient as possible, maybe we could work out a few logistics over email. It sounds like we need to identify the date, location, and attendees for the meeting. Could you shoot over some initial thoughts, and I promise to respond within 24 hours? Then we can set up a time to talk further about questions or outstanding details.” Odds are, if you’re precise in your information request, you can accomplish almost all the objectives via email, and the call may never be necessary.</p><p><strong>Channel requests to your preferred platform</strong>. I’ll sometimes receive a quick note on email or Facebook asking for my phone number—and unless I also believe there’s a good reason for a call, I’ve learned not to give it out because I simply don’t like talking on the phone. I don’t want to look impolite to potential clients or colleagues with a legitimate question, but I’ve realized that just because they want to call me, that doesn’t mean I need to respond to their preferences. Instead, I write back, “The fastest and best way to reach me is through email.” That way, they know I’m happy to talk to them—but through my channel of choice, not theirs.</p><p>I even use my voicemail box to drive home that message, stating, “Hi, this is Dorie Clark. The best way to reach me is through email,” and then give my address. Does that offend some would-be consulting clients? Perhaps. But in a smartphone-enabled world, it’s not that onerous to send an email, and 95% of initial inquiries come to me through my website, anyway. Not to mention the fact that I’d prefer to work with clients who are also mindful of efficiency, and appreciate a fast electronic response, rather than endless phone tag. Answering voicemails used to be a stressful task for me, and I’ve improved the quality of my work life dramatically by eliminating it.</p><p>We’ve spent almost a century with phone calls as a primary driver of productivity in the workplace. But with new tools at our disposal, like email and Slack and text messaging, we may be entering the era where phone calls are more of a hindrance than a help. Now that Millennials have become the <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/05/11/millennials-surpass-gen-xers-as-the-largest-generation-in-u-s-labor-force/\" target=\"_blank\">largest cohort in the U.S. workforce</a>, their attitudes—including a marked preference for short, written communication rather than telephones—are increasingly mainstream.</p><p>Telephones certainly won’t disappear. But, just as radio was eclipsed by television, phones have become a niche product for special circumstances. If you’d like to connect in real time with multiple colleagues, or have an in-depth introductory conversation with a far-flung coworker, setting up a call is still a great option. But unsolicited, impromptu calls are becoming <em>verboten</em> in the workforce—because in a world of too many distractions, wasting someone’s time is a cardinal offense.</p>",

        "content": "<p>MAY 17, 2016 – Liane Davey – HBR</p><p>There it is in your inbox: a meeting invite to a meeting you really don’t want to attend. Maybe because it’s shoe-horned into one of the few remaining white spaces in your calendar. Or it’s for a time that’s already booked, and now you’re left to decide whom to turn down. Whatever the reason, sometimes you need to decline a meeting invite.</p><p>Your first challenge is deciding which meetings to decline. A little discipline goes a long way here. Establish a set of criteria for participation and stick with it.</p><p>Start by assessing <strong>the value of the meeting</strong>. Is the meeting about something important, timely, and worthwhile? Is it set up for success by having a clear purpose and agenda? Is there background information available to inform participants in advance? Are the appropriate people invited so that meaningful progress can be made? If the value of the meeting isn’t clear from the invitation, reply back with a few open-ended questions before making your decision:</p><ul><li>“Could you please provide some additional information on the agenda?”</li><li>“What stage of decision making are we at on this topic?”</li><li>“How should I prepare for the discussion?”</li></ul><p>If it’s clear that the meeting is worthwhile, your next question is whether or not<strong>you’re the right person to attend</strong>. Are the issues within the purview of your role? Do you have the expertise to contribute to the conversation? Are you underqualified or overqualified for the level of decisions on the table? If you’re questioning why you were invited, reach out to the meeting organizer before responding:</p><ul><li>“What are you looking for me to contribute at this meeting?”</li><li>“Who else will be there from my department?”</li><li>“Who will I be representing?”</li></ul><p>Finally, if you believe the meeting will be valuable and that you would make a contribution to the discussions, you need to decide whether or not the meeting is <strong>a priority for you right now</strong>. How central is the meeting topic to your role? Where does the issue fit relative to your other immediate demands? How unique is your contribution and could your seat be better filled by someone else?</p><p>If you can’t say yes to any of the three criteria above, then it’s appropriate to decline the meeting, but tread carefully. You want to leave your co-worker feeling that you’re a good team player and a positive contributor, even if you don’t attend her meeting. Consider a few different options:</p><p><strong>Can I stop the meeting altogether?</strong> If the meeting failed criteria #1 because you don’t believe it’s set up for success, take a moment to talk with the organizer about your concerns. It’s possible the person will dismiss your comments, but it’s possible that you trigger one of two positive outcomes: either the meeting gets better positioned for success or it gets cancelled. Try one of the following approaches:</p><ul><li>“This is an interesting topic. Based on our current year priorities, I’m not sure we’re ready for a productive conversation yet. Would it be possible to push this meeting back and let the working group make a little more progress before we meet?”</li><li>“I’m looking forward to making some decisions on this issue. From the meeting invite, it doesn’t look like Production is involved. I would like to wait until someone from Production is willing to join. Otherwise, we won’t be able to make any decisions.”</li><li>“Based on the information in the invitation, it looks like this meeting is for informational purposes. Would it be possible to get a summary sent out rather than convening a meeting?”</li></ul><p><strong>Can I recommend someone else?</strong> If the meeting is important, but it failed criteria #2 because you’re not the right person for the job, try recommending someone else. Be sure to invest some effort in finding the right person so you don’t appear to be shirking the responsibility. Try floating these options:</p><ul><li>“I’m flattered that you are interested in my input. I don’t believe I’m the best qualified on this topic. I did a little digging and it looks like Pat would have the necessary context. Would you be comfortable inviting Pat rather than me?”</li><li>“Given that this is a decision-making meeting, I think it’s more appropriate to have my manager represent our team.”</li><li>“Thanks for the invite to this meeting. I don’t think I’m required at this point. If it’s alright with you, I’d like to send Jose as my delegate.”</li></ul><p><strong>Can I contribute in advance?</strong> If the meeting failed criterion #3 (you determined that it was an important topic on which you could add unique value, but attending the meeting doesn’t fit with your schedule or priorities), you have the opportunity to add value in advance. Take a few minutes to pull together some notes and to brief the chair or a suitable participant. That will be much more efficient than attending the entire meeting. You can respond to the organizer by saying:</p><ul><li>“This is going to be an important discussion. I’m not able to attend, but I will find some time to share my thoughts so you can include them in the discussion.”</li><li>“I’m sorry that I can’t attend the meeting. If I prepare you in advance, could I ask that you represent my ideas at the meeting?”</li></ul><p><strong>Can I attend for part of the meeting?</strong> If one or more agenda items did meet all three of your criteria, whereas others didn’t, you might have the option of attending for part of the meeting. You can respond with one of the following:</p><ul><li>“Thanks for the invite. I think it’s really important for me to be part of the discussion on rebranding. Given a few other priorities at the moment, I’m going to excuse myself once that item is complete.”</li><li>“Would it be possible to cover the rebranding discussion as the first agenda item? I can’t stay for the entire meeting but I’d really like to contribute on that one.”</li></ul><p>Regardless of which option you choose, you’re trying to do three things. First, model deliberateness about the use of time. Second, share your rationale so that the meeting organizer has some context for why you’re not participating. Third, make an effort to meet the organizer’s needs, even if it’s not in the way they had originally envisioned.</p><p>It might be a bit of a culture shock at first, but all the overwhelmed people with 35 hours a week of meetings will quickly admire your discipline. Just remember, you need to afford the same courtesy to the people who decline the invites you send!</p>",

And <a href=\"http://www.blissyoupro.com\">Bliss You Pro</a> offers tailors-made programs to companies in order to  increase the well-being and performances of employees with mind-body practices and alternative medicine.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>What is the history of Bliss You?</strong></p><p>Bliss You was created 8 months ago. This is primarily a platform which put in relation practitioners in alternative medicine and individuals. Alternative medicine includes several practices such as relaxation therapy, yoga, meditation, self-hypnosis&#8230; The common point of all these practices is that they appeal to the natural capacity for self-healing we all have. So we have a BtoC space, where each practitioner proposes what he wants, I assure a selection for these practitioners, and a BtoB part, more focused, where I organize special sessions for companies .</p><p>Before creating Bliss You, I worked 6 years in marketing innovation. It was a challenging environment with a lot of stress to deal with. Today, stress becomes somewhat rewarding, a performance marker. But this is not a good model of life in the long run, it undermines the motivation and performance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Today, we often define ourselves by work. Do you think that we should redefine our relationship to work?</strong></p><p>I think we should see work as a space of Life. The professional and personal spheres influence each other a lot, so the company must become prescriptive of life changes, it should take the place of large institutions to ensure the welfare of its employees. The company must demonstrate a good will into employees&#8217; privacy. This is their new role.</p><p></p><p><strong>How can these practices improve corporate performance?</strong></p><p>It creates a security bubble, a relationship with oneself which deals with your corporeality. This is to disconnect from the daily workflow to reconnect with yourself. It allows to develop real breaks in the rhythm of work. This distanceyou take allows to boost your creativity and your ability to solve problems.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is self hypnosis?</strong></p><p>It is therapeutic hypnosis, often used in hospitals, the goal is to use the subconscious to set goals, such as having more confidence, better sleep&#8230; This is pretty pragmatic. In business there are many fears, such as not being up to something, quarrel with collegues&#8230; The goal is to use the subconscious to disable these fears and soothe the employee.</p><p></p><p><strong>You offer coaching to non-violent communication, what is it?</strong></p><p>It is a tool to teach employees to step back and think before reacting. We often react over a short time, but we must learn to think before speaking. If you get a violent mail, wait a moment, do not answer to violence with violence. There are language tricks to allow employees to continue working in benevolence. We must cultivate it to create more trust and collaboration in companies, and less frustration.</p><p></p><p><strong>Does it imply to do extensive work on the collective?</strong></p><p>It also requires the manager to do this work, it takes a lot of time and energy. Often they do not have the time and energy so they do not. It also demands a lot of will to get out of complicated situations.</p><p>There is also a need for the manager to reinvent his role. He becomes someone who will create link in the company, between employees, rather than just giving orders.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is there a change in mentality? What is the profile of the most receptive companies?</strong></p><p>This is changing in profound ways. HR are transforming themselves and alternative medicine are welcome. But there is no typical profile for companies, it depends on the HRD and his personality. Today there are many large groups for whom it is important to bet on human capital.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you have an advice for stressed consultants ?</strong></p><p>Listen to your body, know your limits and do not go exceed them.</p>",

It was special patients, they were not very keen on drugs. As doctors, we were lacking in solutions of support, it was necessary to find alternatives. As I am from India, I have an interest in traditional medicines and yoga, so I told myself that it could be a good contribution.</p><p>Also, during my medical studies, I was particularly stressed, which caused me heartburn. Only Mind-Body practices, such as yoga and meditation, worked with me.</p><p>In terms of prevention, these alternative practices are an important contribution. There are often somatic manifestations of stress at work.</p><p>Work stress, burnout, is still a little known disease. 70% of consultations with general practitioners are related to stress.</p><p>Moreover, this is when I was working in a NATO research group that I discovered the concept of integrative health. In the USA, it has been 20 years they are developing it. It is an officially recognized practice, and whole services are dedicated to it in hospitals and universities, as well as wellbeing programs at workplace.</p><p></p><p><strong>How did you create the Institute of Integrative Health?</strong></p><p>At first I went to the USA to make a documentary. I wanted to see first how the USA have integrated the old medicines, and then go in India to see how they had integrated new technologies, and then see what was the situation in Europe.</p><p>There is often in Europe a division between the different practices. I was very nurtured by the american practices of integrative health and I thought about staying there. Finally I came back to give impetus to the health of tomorrow in France and I created the Institute of Integrative Health. I especially wanted to bring solutions to burnout. Integrative Health provides these tools. It takes into account the health of the caregiver. To be a good caregiver you must be in good health, it’s the same in any job. .</p><p></p><p><strong>What is integrative health?</strong></p><p>In a word, it is to reconcile the best of modern technology with the best of ancient wisdom.</p><p></p><p><strong>How new technologies can change health practices?</strong></p><p>It is often thought that traditional practices are opposed to technology, but in fact it puts the human in the center of the technology. For example with all the monitoring tools, also with compliance, people continue to take care of them by themselves. For people who have a chronic illness, they have access to valuable data on their health through technology.</p><p>There is much talk of medicine 3.0. With advances in high tech some say that within 50 years we won’t need doctors anymore. But it is a mistake to put only the high tech forward. Humans are also very important. Through practices such as eating better, you can reconnect to the intelligence of the body. Listening to the waves of the seasons is also a good way to perform when you are in good shape (summer energy) and slow down when your metabolism gets down (winter).</p><p></p><p><strong>Today work has a central place in society, you define yourself by work, should we change this relationship to work?</strong></p><p>In all ancient philosophies, one wonders « who am I », what is my place in life? So inevitably work is important.</p><p>But we must rather understand it as a mission of life rather than a « to do thing », give new meaning.</p><p>Do not put it away, partition between life and work, because in this case we are somewhat schizophrenic, and it contributes to chronic stress. Rather make work a self-realization element. Give more sense and purpose to it.</p><p></p><p><strong>How to bring someone to love his job?</strong></p><p>Every morning, you could do a little ritual of a few minutes, inviting what would make you happy to do that day, inviting what might make you feel good. For example having a meaningful conversation with a colleague, nurturing for yourself. It puts the brain in a more welcoming attitude, and not an attitude of resistance. Plus, it stimulates the production of wellbeing hormons such as sérotonine.</p><p></p><p><strong>Would you have an advice for stressed people?</strong></p><p>You have an inner compass, who knows what is good for you, and if every day you take the time to reconnect with your inner compass, which knows what is good for you, it would be a great start. Try to focus in your breathe just 2 minutes in the morning. Just observe, without changing anything. There is a very calming « gap » between the inhale and the exhale. Relax into it. Even if subtle. It’s Worth it&#8230;</p>",

People now have so many alternatives to text messaging (Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Google) they can barely remember the time when text messages were expensive.

Since then, the triumph of videophone communication has been a standard item in most sci-fi movies. Even though it took time for videophone services to actually be used and even though these services still leave a lot to be desired, they have now finally become a reality for many workers and users.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepresence\">Telepresence</a> is spreading in the corporate world where virtual meetings have become common. Face-to-face meetings have not disappeared&mdash;far from it&mdash;but many companies want to cut the travel costs of their executive staff. It&rsquo;s become much more common for workers to spread across different time zones to schedule late&mdash;or early&mdash;video meetings. Skype, Google, Facebook, or WhatsApp have made communication cheap and spread the use of video conversations. But because these services aren&rsquo;t always high-quality, other corporate actors, like <a href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/immersive-telePresence/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collaboration-endpoints/immersive-telePresence/index.html\"><strong>Cisco</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxJIez1Zy78\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxJIez1Zy78\"><strong>HP</strong></a>, have developed more sophisticated corporate tools that require costly studios.</p><p>The smartphone revolution has made the lack of infrastructure (roads, highways) slightly less dramatic for some countries. Developing countries have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrogging\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrogging\">leapfrogged</a> to a new communication technology, going directly to mobile long before everyone was equipped with landline phones. According to the World Bank, a 10% increase in the number of mobile phones can bring about nearly one extra GDP point. It&rsquo;s a powerful development tool.</p><p>In the startup world, collaborative tools such as Slack have transformed the way people work. Email and phone are on the decline. In startups, remote work is made easy by the use of such collaborative tools. Distance is thus very relative. Teams are often organized virtually.</p><p>Meanwhile, in their private lives, users have massively converted to videophone communication and &lsquo;augmented&rsquo; reality. They do &ldquo;Skype dinners&rdquo;. They use Facebook Live. Many of them leave a video service on at all times.

One just needs to look at the rise of real estate prices in big cities like San Francisco, Hong Kong, London, Paris, and even Berlin, to see that people tend to flock to high-density areas rather than leave these areas to enjoy empty beaches. In Europe, many rural areas are emptier than ever before.

The need to be in a community of like-minded individuals and to dwell in economically rich areas is stronger. <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/the-decline-of-the-drivers-license/425169/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/the-decline-of-the-drivers-license/425169/\">Fewer people</a> (including the so-called nomads) have a driving license precisely because they plan to spend all their lives in high-density areas where public transportation and ride-sharing services are widespread.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;According to a new study from the University of Michigan, the percentage of 16- to 44-year-olds with driver&rsquo;s licenses has decreased significantly in the past few decades. But it&rsquo;s been particularly pronounced among the youngest part of that group. The percentages of 20- to 24-year-olds who had licenses &ldquo;in 1983, 2008, 2011 and 2014 were 91.8%, 82%, 79.7%, and 76.7%, respectively.&rdquo; Almost a quarter of young adults don&rsquo;t even know how to drive. How did we move from a country where having a car was the single most important sign of independence to one in which respondents actually told researchers that they were &ldquo;too busy&rdquo; to get a license?&rdquo; (<a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/01/31/why-are-fewer-young-people-getting-drivers-licenses/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/01/31/why-are-fewer-young-people-getting-drivers-licenses/\">The New York Post</a>, 2016)</p></blockquote><p>Because they have increasingly complicated and messy careers, most people are forced to stay in high-density areas where they have more professional opportunities. The need for a dense personal and professional network is all the bigger when you need (or want) to switch jobs regularly. Furthermore, as traditional institutions such as unions, corporations and government are doing less to protect individuals against risks, we will need to rely on our families and networks even more. The line between personal and professional networks is becoming increasingly blurry: each and every one of us is trying to grow their own personal &ldquo;startup&rdquo;, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Hoffman\"><strong>Reid Hoffman</strong></a>, LinkedIn&rsquo;s CEO, explained in <a href=\"http://www.thestartupofyou.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.thestartupofyou.com/\"><strong><em>The Startup of You</em></strong></a>. So the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_class\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_class\">creative class</a>&rdquo; has never been so urban. Even just a few decades ago, there were many more lawyers and doctors in small towns and rural areas.

The number of these places has risen very fast over the past few years. The concept was first introduced by sociologist Ray Oldenburg in the last 1980s to refer to all the places that are neither home nor office. In his influential book <a title=\"The Great Good Place (Oldenburg)\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Good_Place_%28Oldenburg%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Good_Place_%28Oldenburg%29\"><em>The Great Good Place</em></a>, <a title=\"Ray Oldenburg\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Oldenburg\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Oldenburg\">Ray Oldenburg</a>argues that third places are important for civil society, democracy, and civic engagement. Many people launch and test new ideas in such places. So really, working on a beach in Thailand is not that common for most nomad workers, who, more often than not, need the dynamism of urban coworking spaces&mdash;and a proper wifi connection which can&rsquo;t be had everywhere!</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oldenburg calls one&rsquo;s &ldquo;first place&rdquo; the home and those that one lives with. The &ldquo;second place&rdquo; is the workplace &mdash; where people may actually spend most of their time. Third places, then, are &ldquo;anchors&rdquo; of community life and facilitate and foster broader, more creative interaction.&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place\">Wikipedia</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, all areas are not equal when it comes to education. Nomads with children will tend to choose to live where the education offer is denser. Among those who could actually choose to live and work in the country (more experienced remote workers), many have children old enough to go to school. For them geographic freedom is a bit more limited. Although<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling\">home schooling</a> is indeed a growing trend, it is still negligible.</p><p>Last but not least, the very small &ldquo;elite&rdquo; of hyper-connected entrepreneurs who can actually work anywhere they choose, have earned that freedom after many months or years of hard work and networking in high-density places. It&rsquo;s still hard to grow a network on a desert island!</p></div></div></section><section><div><hr /></div><div><div>        <h4>&hellip;and for companies</h4><p>For a company, the choice of one&rsquo;s headquarters matters a lot. As shown by all the discussions around Brexit, there are regulatory, tax and monetary factors that can represent life-altering barriers for companies. Most of all, recruiting talent is increasingly a matter of life and death: it is key to be where the talent is.</p><p>In the industrial age, when factories and machines represented huge costs, companies chose to locate their production in areas where space could be cheaper, often far from city centers, where workers could also find cheap housing. Factories could be found anywhere: in the outer suburbs of large cities or in rural areas. In a way, the industrial age contributed to a better geographic distribution of jobs, activity and people. Geography didn&rsquo;t matter so much. Then companies relocated their factories in third-world countries with a cheaper workforce. Transportation costs were so low that again geography didn&rsquo;t matter so much.</p><p>In the digital age, conversely, the concentration of companies in high-density areas is increasingly high. Because more value can be created in less space (there is no need for big factories anymore), it is easier for companies to be where everybody is&mdash;where real-estate is expensive. Synergies, intersections, emulation, cross-fertilization are what makes the &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; a reality for a company. You just have to be where the others are if you want to be in a position to recruit them.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*bfkCt4rNecRF0FydkAUCcg.png\" data-width=\"2511\" data-height=\"1671\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*bfkCt4rNecRF0FydkAUCcg.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"47\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*bfkCt4rNecRF0FydkAUCcg.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*bfkCt4rNecRF0FydkAUCcg.png\" /></div></div><figcaption>San Francisco</figcaption></figure><p>The localisation of a certain class of assets, like data centers and warehouses, is increasingly strategic for numerous companies. For example, for high-frequency trading companies, a nano-second can make all the difference so they can&rsquo;t afford to locate their centers too far. For Amazon, the promise to deliver everything within 24 hours has forced Amazon to have more warehouses closer to big urban areas. Finally, transportation costs are bound to increase in the near future as some major lines are increasingly saturated.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*kk5-YjLp04ErT9T5aL4pRA.png\" data-width=\"1380\" data-height=\"720\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*kk5-YjLp04ErT9T5aL4pRA.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"40\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*kk5-YjLp04ErT9T5aL4pRA.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*kk5-YjLp04ErT9T5aL4pRA.png\" /></div></div></figure><p>Our work space has changed profoundly: flexible furniture, open spaces and smaller spaces have become the new norm. But at the same time, geography matters more than it used to. Because a company can concentrate more assets in less space, it becomes possible to concentrate all activities in a high-density area where all the users (clients) and workers are also concentrated. The higher concentration of talent and opportunities in a dense area is what drives innovation and creativity.</p></div></div></section><section><div><hr /></div><div><div>        <h4>Conclusion</h4><p>We no longer work the way we used to. The young (and the less young) expect more flexibility. Our work space has changed completely with the emergence of smartphones and laptops. The very notion of work is undergoing unprecedented transformations.</p><p>Yet we do not work from anywhere. For people as well as companies, it has never been more important to be where everybody else is. So some areas are becoming more dense, which makes it harder for workers to find affordable housing.</p><p>Perhaps one day we will actually be able to rely on our virtual avatars, work from anywhere and travel the world. For most of us, that day has not yet come.</p></div></div></section></div></div></section>",

        "content": "<p>FEBRUARY 08, 2016 — Cassandra Frangos — HBR</p></div><p>I ran into a former HR colleague at a conference last month. We got to talking and she mentioned she was finding it difficult to hire a cybersecurity expert. I wasn’t surprised. Security talent is scarce in the tech sector right now. “I found someone phenomenal, but she’s in Washington State, and she won’t move to our cybersecurity group in San Francisco,” my friend lamented.</p><p>I said the first words that popped into my head: “That’s great.”</p><p>Hiring a candidate who is going to work remotely has three levels of benefits.</p><ol><li>The company benefits. Removing location as a limiting factor offers organizations access to (literally) all the talent in the world.</li><li>Hiring managers benefit because they have an opportunity to create diverse teams. For instance, it’s widely accepted that people who come together from different backgrounds bring new information and diverse perspectives.</li><li>Individual employees benefit, because they can live where they want, close to family or perhaps in a place that has the type of climate they prefer.</li></ol><p>Most organizations say they are more open-minded than ever about virtual teams, and yet they still have old-school systems in place for hiring people across the country or around the world. From where I sit, the overlapping barriers come down to structure, culture, and mindset.</p><p>Structurally, many organizations remain hierarchical. Decisions are still passed down from one to many as opposed to emanating from small, autonomous teams.</p><p>Culturally, the face-to-face meeting is still an important symbol of productivity. Want to finish something? Sit around a table together and get it done.</p><p>Mindset is the toughest impediment of all. Many traditional leaders fear a loss of control if they give people the latitude to work where they can’t be overseen.</p><p>This way of working is no longer sustainable. The talent gap in certain technical specialties, such as security and data science, is one reason. A more universal reason is that removing location as a limiting factor gives organizations a lot more freedom to find and hire the very best global talent — and keep them. How do you make virtual teams the rule rather than the exception? What kind of process do you need in place for hiring that superstar in Washington State? Four things are required:</p><p><strong>Do deeper due diligence.</strong> No matter how sophisticated the process, companies usually design interview questions to rate a candidate’s experience and fit — in other words, to find out whether they have the skills to succeed and the mindset to thrive in their specific corporate culture. In hiring virtual candidates, however, you need to dig deeper.</p><p>This <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/IT-Management/10-Questions-to-Ask-Virtual-Job-Candidates-362301\" target=\"_blank\">next level of direct questioning</a> <em>s</em>hould assess whether the person is independent, passionate about their work, and collaborative. They need to be flexible and willing to travel and know that corporate headquarters is still where the action takes place. In addition, the most important experience this individual should have is past success working remotely. Find out how they made it work and double down on the due diligence.</p><p>I live in Boston — 3,000 miles away from Cisco’s San Jose headquarters. I work with executives around the globe; so being on Telepresence and Webex is a natural way we communicate. Still, there are many times when I need to be at corporate headquarters because important conversations need to occur in person and because informal hallway banter can surface new ideas and accelerate solutions.</p><p><strong>Look at leadership capabilities. </strong>Consider the individual’s leadership style and how he or she projects himself or herself. In order to make an impression from afar, people need to stand out in a crowd and be an advocate for their ideas. In addition, the organization needs to scrutinize not only the candidate but also the manager to whom they will report. Remote employees need someone who will advocate for them regardless of where they live. Does the leader have the experience and dynamism to lead virtual teams? Does she value results over face time? Is her compensation tied to the success of her team?</p><p><strong>Invest heavily in relationships.</strong> I recently ran across a team of three dynamic leaders who manage a business unit in tandem from three separate cities. Operating out of Germany, New Jersey, and San Jose, California, respectively, the trio is a high-functioning, collaborative team. How do they do it? They respect each other and communicate constantly. Initially, they invested significant, in-person time to forge the relationship. They understand each other extremely well and now they finish each other’s sentences. They tackle tough customer issues in unison and are on the phone or video together constantly. They’ve been together for several years and it works because they attend to their relationship.</p><p><strong>Do a logistics and tech check.</strong> Setting people up to succeed off-site requires attention to IT support and infrastructure. Can people easily teleconference from their mobile device or PC? Are all team members comfortable using collaboration tools? Is any data flow to and from the virtual team secure, and do all team members understand the company security protocols? At Cisco, we use technology to make communication as dynamic as possible. When language and cultural differences come into play, for instance, seeing each other over a video feed that’s clear and reliable can make a big difference in deepening the interaction.</p><p>The last part of hiring people who are going to work remotely is knowing when it won’t work. There are some jobs where location is fixed. In some companies, for instance, the head of sales needs to work in close proximity to the CEO. For other mission-critical positions, it is necessary to be face to face with local accounts or available for the community.</p><p>Yet, I would argue that this is quickly becoming the exception, rather than the rule. Knocking down the cultural and psychological barriers that make hiring the best global talent impossible can open everyone’s eyes to the virtues of a more dynamic working environment.</p>",

        "title": "How to Design an Agenda for an Effective Meeting",
        "content": "<p>MARCH 19, 2015 &mdash; Roger Schwarz &mdash; HBR</p><p>We&rsquo;ve all been in meetings where participants are unprepared, people veer off-track, and the topics discussed are a waste of the team&rsquo;s time. These problems &mdash; and others like it &mdash; stem from poor agenda design. An effective agenda sets clear expectations for what needs to occur before and during a meeting. It helps team members prepare, allocates time wisely, quickly gets everyone on the same topic, and identifies when the discussion is complete. If problems still occur during the meeting, a well-designed agenda increases the team&rsquo;s ability to effectively and quickly address them.</p><p>Here are some tips for designing an effective agenda for your next meeting, with a sample agenda and template below. You can use these tips whether a meeting lasts an hour or three days and whether you&rsquo;re meeting with a group of five or forty:</p><p><strong>Seek input from team members.</strong> If you want your team to be engaged in meetings, make sure the agenda includes items that reflect their needs. Ask team members to suggest agenda items along with a reason why each item needs to be addressed in a team setting. If you ultimately decide not to include an item, be accountable &mdash; explain your reasoning to the team member who suggested it.</p><p><strong>Select topics that affect the entire team.</strong> Team meeting time is expensive and difficult to schedule. It should mainly be used to discuss and make decisions on issues that affect the whole team &mdash; and need the whole team to solve them. These are often ones in which individuals must coordinate their actions because their parts of the organization are interdependent. They are also likely to be issues for which people have different information and needs. Examples might include: How do we best allocate shared resources? How do we reduce response time? If the team isn&rsquo;t spending most of the meeting talking about interdependent issues, members will disengage and ultimately not attend.</p><p><strong>List agenda topics as questions the team needs to answer</strong>. Most agenda topics are simply several words strung together to form a phrase, for example: &ldquo;office space reallocation.&rdquo; This leaves meeting participants wondering, &ldquo;What about office space reallocation?&rdquo; When you list a topic as a question (or questions) to be answered, it instead reads like this: &ldquo;Under what conditions, if any, should we reallocate office space?&rdquo;</p><p>A question enables team members to better prepare for the discussion and to monitor whether their own and others&rsquo; comments are on track. During the meeting, anyone who thinks a comment is off-track can say something like, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not seeing how your comment relates to the question we&rsquo;re trying to answer. Can you help me understand the connection?&rdquo; Finally, the team knows that when the question has been answered, the discussion is complete.</p><p><strong>Note whether the purpose of the topic is to share information, seek input for a decision, or make a decision</strong>. It&rsquo;s difficult for team members to participate effectively if they don&rsquo;t know whether to simply listen, give their input, or be part of the decision making process. If people think they are involved in making a decision, but you simply want their input, everyone is likely to feel frustrated by the end of the conversation. Updates are better distributed &mdash; and read &mdash; prior to the meeting, using a brief part of the meeting to answer participants&rsquo; questions. If the purpose is to make a decision, state the decision-making rule. If you are the formal leader, at the beginning of the agenda item you might say, &ldquo;If possible, I want us to make this decision by consensus. That means that everyone can support and implement the decision given their roles on the team. If we&rsquo;re not able to reach consensus after an hour of discussion, I&rsquo;ll reserve the right to make the decision based on the conversation we&rsquo;ve had. I&rsquo;ll tell you my decision and my reasoning for making it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Estimate a realistic amount of time for each topic</strong>. This serves two purposes. First, it requires you to do the math &mdash; to calculate how much time the team will need for introducing the topic, answering questions, resolving different points of view, generating potential solutions, and agreeing on the action items that follow from discussion and decisions. Leaders typically underestimate the amount of time needed. If there are ten people in your meeting and you have allocated ten minutes to decide under what conditions, if any, you will reallocate office space, you have probably underestimated the time. By doing some simple math, you would realize that the team would have to reach a decision immediately after each of the ten members has spoken for a minute.</p><p>Second, the estimated time enables team members to either adapt their comments to fit within the allotted timeframe or to suggest that more time may be needed. The purpose of listing the time is not to stop discussion when the time has elapsed; that simply contributes to poor decision making and frustration. The purpose is to get better at allocating enough time for the team to effectively and efficiently answer the questions before it.</p><p><strong>Propose a process for addressing each agenda item</strong>. The process identifies the steps through which the team will move together to complete the discussion or make a decision. Agreeing on a process significantly increases meeting effectiveness, yet leaders rarely do it. Unless the team has agreed on a process, members will, in good faith, participate based on their own process. You&rsquo;ve probably seen this in action: some team members are trying to define the problem, other team members are wondering why the topic is on the agenda, and still other members are already identifying and evaluating solutions.</p><p>The process for addressing an item should appear on the written agenda. When you reach that item during the meeting, explain the process and seek agreement: &ldquo;I suggest we use the following process. First, let&rsquo;s take about 10 minutes to get all the relevant information on the table. Second, let&rsquo;s take another 10 minutes to identify and agree on any assumptions we need to make. Third, we&rsquo;ll take another 10 minutes to identify and agree on the interests that should be met for any solution. Finally, we&rsquo;ll use about 15 minutes to craft a solution that ideally takes into account all the interests, and is consistent with our relevant information and assumptions. Any suggestions for improving this process?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Specify how members should prepare for the meeting.</strong> Distribute the agenda with sufficient time before the meeting, so the team can read background materials and prepare their initial thoughts for each agenda item ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Identify who is responsible for leading each topic</strong>. Someone other than the formal meeting leader is often responsible for leading the discussion of a particular agenda item. This person may be providing context for the topic, explaining data, or may have organizational responsibility for that area. Identifying this person next to the agenda item ensures that anyone who is responsible for leading part of the agenda knows it &mdash; and prepares for it &mdash; before the meeting.</p><p><strong>Make the first topic &ldquo;review and modify agenda as needed.&rdquo;</strong> Even if you and your team have jointly developed the agenda before the meeting, take a minute to see if anything needs to be changed due to late breaking events. I once had a meeting scheduled with a senior leadership team. As we reviewed the agenda, I asked if we needed to modify anything. The CEO stated that he had just told the board of directors that he planned to resign and that we probably needed to significantly change the agenda. Not all agenda modifications are this dramatic, but by checking at the beginning of the meeting, you increase the chance that the team will use its meeting time most effectively.</p><p><strong>End the meeting with a plus/delta. </strong>If your team meets regularly, two questions form a simple continuous improvement process: What did we do well? What do we want to do differently for the next meeting? Investing five or ten minutes will enable the team to improve performance, working relationships, and team member satisfaction. Here are some questions to consider when identifying what the team has done well and what it wants to do differently:</p><ol>        <li>Was the agenda distributed in time for everyone to prepare?</li><li>How well did team members prepare for the meeting?</li><li>How well did we estimate the time needed for each agenda item?</li><li>How well did we allocate our time for decision making and discussion?</li><li>How well did everyone stay on-topic? How well did team members speak up when they thought someone was off-topic?</li><li>How effective was the process for each agenda item?</li></ol><p>To ensure that your team follows through, review the results of the plus/delta at the beginning of the next meeting.</p><p>If you develop agendas using these tips, and the sample agenda and template below, your team will have an easier time getting &mdash; and staying &mdash; focused in meetings.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2Fresources%2Fimages%2Farticle_assets%2F2015%2F03%2FW150313_SCHWARZ_SAMPLEMEETING-1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.evernote.com/shard/s280/sh/02e77816-98fa-4587-9fd0-3dd50c8a0284/a3d18337fdcef71e/res/ebc85ab4-add3-4fea-a181-633a31a2e70a.png?resizeSmall&amp;width=832\" alt=\"W150313_SCHWARZ_SAMPLEMEETING (1)\" width=\"659\" height=\"1032\" name=\"ebc85ab4-add3-4fea-a181-633a31a2e70a\" /></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2Fresources%2Fimages%2Farticle_assets%2F2015%2F03%2FW150313_SCHWARZ_MEETINGAGENDA-1.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.evernote.com/shard/s280/sh/02e77816-98fa-4587-9fd0-3dd50c8a0284/a3d18337fdcef71e/res/c313e882-2e88-44d3-be9a-59748add78fb.png?resizeSmall&amp;width=832\" alt=\"W150313_SCHWARZ_MEETINGAGENDA (1)\" width=\"645\" height=\"880\" name=\"c313e882-2e88-44d3-be9a-59748add78fb\" /></a></p>",

Before, I worked in a company with too large offices. Friends were first called to fill the empty space and then we created a website to rent space to other people. Then other people used this website to put ads on their empty space. Then the wave of co-working has arrived, and we also put the co-working spaces on the site.</p><p>Our users are companies who want to rent space. Also VSE / SMEs seeking a flexible space. There are also many independents, almost half of the users, and this is growing. These people will not stay to work at home, where there is no social dynamics. When one is isolated it’s less interesting for his intellectual abilities. Like when you go to the library to study, or when you go to the gym. No reason to stay home.</p><p>We are social animals, work is the largest share of social interactions.</p><p></p><p><strong>So these are people who work side by side but not together, is there a creative emulation?</strong></p><p>Yes, we made a survey and half of the people in coworking spaces have worked at least once with a co-worker. When you have the same specialty as the neighbor, you talk about it and it gives ideas. If you meet every day, there are affects and expertise that are brewed. Like when you need salt at home, you will go to see your neighbor. There is a collaborative friction.</p><p></p><p><strong>With digitalization, we speak of digital nomadism, people who have no ties or offices. In this context, may workspaces be deserted? Should workspaces reinvent themselves?</strong></p><p>There is no work space, there are work tasks, and for each type of task you need a suitable space. For a call you must be isolated, for a meeting you need a closed room, for managing a mail an open space is enough. There are tasks in the job that lead to a particular space. For example, a graphic designer needs a big screen.</p><p>There are always tasks you cannot do with nomadism. Each task requires a level of concentration, a level of silence. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s important.</p><p>But there is also a social function. Our idea is to create spaces of Life. If you move all the time you cannot create social bonds. So nomadism has its limits, both in work and in social ties.</p><p></p><p><strong>With the rise of freelance and flexible models, could we consider entire companies without local?</strong></p><p>There are no rules, we are in a society where work has evolved. But we&#8217;re going to more fragmented companies. There are people who have less need to socialize.</p><p>Yes there will be exploded fragmented companies, but there is also still a need for physical meeting.</p><p>It exists, but it must also times when we meet together, a company is also a common culture.</p><p>It also depends on the culture of the company. If it is a strong culture, you have to create a mood. If the culture is strong it is complicated to fragment the company.</p><p></p><p><strong>We see more and more people who rent a place in their own house to workers, what opinion do you have on this trend?</strong></p><p>Co-working started like this, in a salon. But the question is : is the home environment suitable for professional tasks? It&#8217;s not very professional, not very suitable for a business environment. That might satisfy a few people but it remains binding. You also have less work emulation.</p><p></p><p><strong>Something to add ?</strong></p><p>I think co-working is really the model of tomorrow, it&#8217;s going to fit with the new working practices. I strongly believe in this booming wave. It foreshadows a profound change in our society.</p>",

What motivates her: transforming work environments.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>What is your background and your current role?</strong></p><p>I have a formation in urbanism, I made urban studies related to the economic dimension of territories, then I specialized in the corporate world. I first worked at Mobilitis, a consulting firm in mobility and at CBRE. And now I&#8217;m at Kurt Salmon, to assist companies in their needs in moving and development.</p><p>10-15 years ago, my job did not exist. There were interior designers, then there was the job of space planner, people who draw plans for the company, but with the former codes, without social thinking on the uses of space by employees. Now, a consulting part in work environment began to emerge, so we have more contacts with DHR, CFO, employees &#8230;</p><p></p><p><strong>What are the major trends in terms of layout of work spaces?</strong></p><p>You first have the company that wants to save money, the company wants to reduce the surface or get away from big cities. But not only. Financial directors don’t decide alone now, but the HRD decide too. One of the major trend is to ensure that the working environment is of quality, this is an equation full of unknowns.</p><p>The trend today is to customize the spaces, we want to open up the space, also make it flexible. One wonders what spaces to offer its employees. For that we need to understand the customs and ways of working to adapt the space.</p><p></p><p><strong>On the employee side, the comfort of the work space is a decisive criterion, how to combine space of life, leisure, and work space?</strong></p><p>We have to understand the different moments an employee spends in his company. There&#8217;s a moment spent alone, a moment for collaboration, a moment to think and be innovative &#8230; We must therefore understand all these moments and adapt the space.</p><p></p><p><strong>This new trend of making workspaces fun, is it adopted by HRDs?</strong></p><p>The idea of fun areas to work is inspired by the culture of Silicon Valley. It is fashionable, but installing a water slide in the company might not suit all companies. In a very hierarchical company, it would be pointless to put a slide because it would never be used, it would go against the habits and practices of the company. Google&#8217;s model cannot be transcribed everywhere.</p><p>The goal is to think like the user, to transcribe its strategy, it is not to impose something but to open his mind to new practices.</p><p></p><p><strong>The professional nomadism is now a strong trend, in the future could the workspace disappear? How workspaces should reinvent itself?</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s true that if you go after this reasoning, you think that the traditionnal office is dead, but it is reinventing itself. There is an important human problem, we all need to be located in one place. You need social ties, yet we sometimes need to meet physically. So when you return to your company this is to have an experience together, exchange and collaboration. So the company will transform itself, maybe we&#8217;ll go over to places like agora, forums, to talk, exchange, rather than having workstations. Or we come back completely on a reactionary tendency, we are at the crossroads of something that will evolve.</p><p></p><p><strong>In the company, there are more and more freelance and staff delegation, how to integrate external and create a corporate culture with so many non-permanent workers?</strong></p><p>Until now there was a desire to create links, to put non-permanent workers together with everybody, but then for financial reasons of we tend to pack them, reduce the allocated space, or we assign them unassigned offices, or we encourage their mobility out of the company. Generally, companies ask us to advantage more the permanent workers in the workspace.</p><p></p><p><strong>Regarding the digital innovations, are we going to build intelligent building, where new technologies are integrated?</strong></p><p>It is mandatory. Everything must be logged in. All what concerns support activities is increasingly requested. For example you can immediately know what meeting rooms are available. Or you have sound level sensors in the open space. If the level is exceeded, everyone receives a message.</p><p>All buildings that emerge today have obligations in terms of energy consumption. For companies, be certified is also a communication tool.</p><p>Sustainable development is becoming more a reflex.</p><p></p><p><strong>Are there sometimes staff resistance to a redevelopment project?</strong></p><p>Yes, I always have to lead groups of expression, because there are always people who have fears, for example on the open space. There is an ancient representation of the open space where everyone were put together. But now it has nothing to do, there is a reflection on the use of space. There is also a tension on the individual office, people are afraid to lose it, because previously the status was measured by the size of your office. It is a fear about its place in the company. The office is seen as a continuation of the person.</p><p>We must show that the work environment changes, it may be qualitative. It means you have to hear the employees, explain, give meaning. Do not go with preconceptions, there is not companies which are more open to change than others.</p><p>Often, employees themselves are also eager for change.</p>",

This is largely to provide the necessary autonomy in this area for people who want to be entrepreneurs.</p><p>Romain Paillard, the founder and develops his vision of learning: <em>To simplify, there are now two macro elements in learning: first a cultural, educational and societal corpus, that must be seen as a necessary foundation for all learning, it may be middle and high school.</em> <em>Then grafted onto this base you have large vertical trunks, very general knowledge units that are considered indivisible.</em> <em>Now it is well known that a student who comes from a university or school will not use in his professional life more than 10% of what he learned, I know something about that with my 8 years of law studies!</em></p><p><em>The idea is to graft on the base, instead of large units, a variety of small, concrete and directly applicable programs.</em> <em>The shortened format of 9 weeks, hyper intensive, should indeed perfectly suit to teach only the 10% of knowledge that will actually requested in the professional world.</em> <em>This new model of education is actually better suited to the slashers era we are entering.</em></p><p></p><p>This flexibility and hyper-efficiency in acquiring key skills make vocational training a big competitive advantage, both for the individual and for the company. In France for example, credits for vocational training, managed by the unions, are difficult to obtain and little solicited.</p><p>Romain Paillard regrets it: <em>Of all the rights of the employee, training is the only element that makes him more productive.</em> <em>Training helps to accomplish your duty to remain curious throughout your life and to improve yourself.</em> <em>But in France, training is the only right of the employees for which the unions never fight.</em> <em>The last reform of vocational training, for example, is completely unreadable!</em> <em>By making in France, the possibilities of vocational training fuzzy or even repulsive, we broke the duty to be curious, and it&#8217;s a tragedy!</em></p><p><em>Training is nevertheless a big competitive advantage, it must give back will to society, recreate the flow and break social stratification.</em> <em>It is about, here, societal resilience, giving the company the flexibility and resources to adapt to our changing world.</em></p><p></p><p>In this new world, where it is possible to quickly acquire accurate knowledge, the challenge is no longer to have a large stock of knowledge, but to develop an ability to quickly integrate new models, adapt, to question them and even create new ones. In other words, what makes the value of the individual, it is the soft skills, the attitude. They are also increasingly valued by companies.</p><p>The question is how to develop these famous soft skills. If there is no miracle recipe, the philosopher Alain de Botton shows us some lines of thought. He created the School of Life in London in 2008, an institution dedicated to the development of &#8220;emotional intelligence&#8221; through culture. Courses on key issues of everyday life are taught, such as &#8220;find a fulfilling job,&#8221; &#8220;master the art of conversation,&#8221; &#8220;keep calm&#8221; &#8230;</p><p>Alain de Botton explains: <em>I started all this because I had the feeling that schools fail to teach you a lot of important things in this world.</em> <em>Where are we supposed to learn human relationships?</em> <em>Management of his career?</em> <em>Children&#8217;s education ?</em> <em>The management of friendship?</em> <em>How to deal with anxiety and death?</em> <em>All these things that I wanted to learn when I was a student and up to date.</em> <em>I wanted to do of the School of Life a one-stop information about this area of life that I call emotional intelligence.</em></p><p>Just as the rise of freelance and the evolution of professional training, start-up spirit is part of a changing society. The <sup>21st</sup> century, the one of the creative economy, is marked by a requirement of inventiveness, collaboration and decompartmentalization. But often, these start-ups must be accompanied by incubators. These must be both workspaces, coaches, as well as vectors of federation and collaboration, able to gather a mass of creative potential around an identity and a common ideal of society, just like a guild or a union. These qualities make incubators spearhead of this societal upheaval.</p><p>The Family, founded in 2013 in Paris by Alice Zagury Oussama Ammar and Nicolas Colin, is one of them. Alice Zagury speaks about it:</p><p><em>In general, the first barrier to innovation is education;</em> <em>it&#8217;s a whole mindset to change!</em> <em>When we decided to found The Family, our priority was above all to give a lot of thought patterns, and see if startups cling to it. </em>We<em> also act primarily as a start-up union;</em> <em>we come to see the big companiess to use their tools at attractive conditions.</em> <em>Finally,we give courses, we organize dinners to create a dynamic community, and especially we closely accompany each start-up &#8230;</em></p><p>As an incubator, the role of The Family is also to provide training to start-ups, but this training must be extremely practical and directly related to the problems encountered. According to Alice Zagury: <em>When accompanying a start-up, our goal is not reassuring, you have ambition or not, the goal is not to convince anyone he is capable.</em> <em>Yes, we are here to help them, but without any sugar coat.</em> <em>We are actually more hard-core than the average of incubators in our returns and our accompaniment.</em> <em>The idea is to accelerate the phenomenon of making choices.</em> <em>Avoid the ellipsis.</em> <em>So it is rather steep for them, they are forced to engage immediately in action rather than refine the concept indefinitely, which is not really in the French mindset.</em></p><p><em>After one year, 100 start-ups trusted The Family.</em> <em>People knew we were dedicated, we had a network, and especially we had bought freedom, functioning without any public money.</em></p><p>The Family is also intended to play a role in society, in the sense of a general decompartmentalization. The premise of Alice Zagury is that the disruption should be in diversity, she said, the start up dynamic must go beyond the social stratification:</p><p><em>We try to make diversity.</em> <em>But there is no real frontier between Paris and the suburbs, there is a phenomenon of self-censorship, people put barriers themselves: never anyone, almost, from the suburbs comes to The Family, even if we are very demanding!</em> The <em>more frustration there is, the more The Family makes sense.</em></p><p><em>We are also here in response to the frustration of a generation, tired of a certain elitism, a permanent stagnation in the markets, often blocked.</em> <em>We want to provide an answer to this frustration.</em> <em>But this dynamic, it would exist without us, we only accompany it.</em></p><p>As part of the new digital and creative economies, training and even the act of learning are deeply transformed in their very nature. But it is essential to support these developments because it is the training that will give to the individuals the necessary keys and mindset to adapt to our changing world and not to remain on the sidelines of the 21st <sup>century.</sup></p><p></p>",

        "content": "<p>APRIL 01, 2016 — Hal Gregersen — HBR</p><div> During a time when many retailers are struggling, business is <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/24/target-walmart-holiday-shopping/?iid=sr-link1\" target=\"_blank\">booming</a> at Target. But it wasn’t too long ago that the discount retailer’s future didn’t glow so bright. When CEO Brian Cornell took the reins two years ago, he inherited a company that had been struggling for years, taking far too few risks, and sticking too close to the core.</div><div><p>Since then the world has fallen in love with a far edgier Target, which has <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/target-narrows-the-bullseye-with-emphasis-on-signature-products-1410293111\" target=\"_blank\">expanded its offerings through collaborations </a>with such power brands as Lilly Pulitzer, Toms, Neiman Marcus, and SoulCycle, and updated product lines that break the status quo, like its latest gender-neutral kids home brand <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/08/target-gender-neutral/\" target=\"_blank\">Pillowfort</a>. But Cornell didn’t start right out of the gate making any big changes like these. Instead, he took time to carefully contemplate his approach, listen to his team, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/24/how-asking-tough-questions-could-save-your-career/\" target=\"_blank\">ask questions</a>.</p><p>At the MIT Leadership Center, I recently <a href=\"http://leadership.mit.edu/creating-the-environment-for-powerful-questions-mlc-interview-with-guy-wollaert/\" target=\"_blank\">spoke with</a> another leader, Guy Wollaert, chief exploration officer at Loggia Strategy &amp; Design, about similar experiences he encountered at another highly visible brand, Coca-Cola. During his 20-plus year tenure with the global beverage brand, most recently serving as its chief technical and innovation officer, Wollaert made it a point to seek — and surround himself with — new ideas and people who challenged him to reflect and question first, then act later.</p><p>When stakes are high, it can be difficult for leaders, especially senior ones new to their roles, to pause before acting. Here’s advice for how to give yourself time to reflect and lead with questions, based on insights from Wollaert’s and Cornell’s leadership journeys:</p><h3><strong>Create a questioning ecosystem through diverse teams</strong></h3><p>Successful leadership isn’t just about the leader, it’s about the team. For initiatives to take hold, leaders must purposefully create diverse teams internally while seeking unique perspectives externally, whether from business partners or customers.</p><p>When Wollaert was asked to create a new function called the Global Juice Center, he literally followed the oranges from the groves to the consumer, speaking with stakeholders along the way, to understand every step of the juice-making process and to identify where there was opportunity for change. Unlike Coca-Cola’s traditional products that have a formulaic recipe, its juice products are reliant on Mother Nature for ingredients, which can vary sharply in quality from year-to-year. Through Wollaert’s hands-on experience in the field, he learned that to win in the unpredictable beverage business, extreme flexibility throughout the operations and within the team was essential.</p><p>A self-described “strong believer in diversity of thinking and diversity of personalities,” Wollaert made it his quest to bring varied perspectives to his team. His frequent field observations combined with the creation of a diversified team not only improved the Global Juice Center’s procurement process, but helped it do so in a more sustainable manner.</p><p>Similarly, after being named CEO, Cornell reorganized the inner <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/target-ceo-makes-leadership-changes-to-emphasize-innovation-digital/286160261/\" target=\"_blank\">leadership circle at Target</a>, promoting talent who had been with the company for years while also recruiting outside talent who brought with them deep knowledge and experience from other companies.</p><p>At the same time, Cornell <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3038070/target-partners-with-story-for-worlds-tweeest-holiday-shop\" target=\"_blank\">visited stores in person</a>. To gain perspective on the business from multiple angles, he spent considerable time talking with customers and team members to hear from them what worked and what didn’t. He found that collecting first-hand information proved far more likely to provoke valuable new questions than pre-existing second hand information scattered around headquarters.</p><h3><strong>Stay curious</strong></h3><p>Curiosity shouldn’t end when you find one solution to a problem. Leaders must constantly explore new ideas themselves, seek out new thinking from those around them, and create partnerships. <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/23/larry-page-steve-jobs-walt-disney-business-ideas/?iid=leftrail\" target=\"_blank\">Seeking serendipitous connections</a> across ideas – and people – brings new opportunity.</p><p>Exploring this interconnectivity between seemingly unrelated areas plays an important role in Wollaert’s leadership. An architect by training, he is constantly figuring out ways to connect dots between present and future. He says the same design patterns can be found everywhere, emphasizing the need to be eternally curious.</p><p>“Why are we doing it that way?” was the guiding question that fueled Wollaert’s curiosity when he first joined the Coca-Cola Company designing new factories. “I found those questions were not always as basic as I thought. If you want to design a good factory you have to know what happens before and you have to know what happens after. You put it into the bigger context.”</p><div></div><p>When conceptualizing new ideas at Target, Cornell visited <a href=\"http://www.fastcodesign.com/3038070/target-partners-with-story-for-worlds-tweeest-holiday-shop#20\" target=\"_blank\">Story</a>, a Manhattan concept store that remakes itself every eight weeks, and talked with its founder Rachel Shechtman. Knowing Target needed to regain merchandizing authority, Cornell jumped on the opportunity to create a connection between Target’s merchandise and products from new brands. It was through his meeting with Shechtman that a new concept for Target — its “Home for the Holidays” collection — was born.</p><h3><strong>Challenge the status quo, and when needed, start from scratch</strong></h3><p>Sometimes asking uncomfortable questions means making tough decisions about an existing strategy or abandoning it all together. Wollaert values the<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/09/17/amazon-founder-ceo-jeff-bezos-skills/?iid=leftrail\" target=\"_blank\">power of experimentation</a>, even if it means starting over.</p><p>“I found across my career in this business that people tend to be very, very good at continuously improving things — and it’s important, don’t get me wrong,” explained Wollaert. “But I’ve also experienced that people are much less comfortable just imagining you can start from scratch. A blank sheet of paper can indeed be very daunting.”</p><p>While it’s both empowering and daunting, starting from scratch opens up an incredible amount of questions, allowing leaders to step back and look at the big picture. Cornell may be CEO of the second largest discount retailer in the U. S., but he hasn’t lost the spirit that keeps entrepreneurs seeking change rather than waiting to adapt to change. Instead of sticking with the status quo, Cornell took the right, measured risks. More recently, he’s been experimenting with new <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fcorporate.target.com%2Farticle%2Ftag%2F4345%2FFlexible-Format\" target=\"_blank\">flexible-format stores</a>, scrapping the big-box feel to offer customers convenience with stores that are completely customized to the surrounding neighborhood’s needs. Once opened, he and his team plan to <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-target-brian-cornell-executive-qa-1132-biz-20151119-story.html\" target=\"_blank\">listen, learn, and iterate</a>.</p><p>Leaders like Cornell and Wollaert question everything, surround themselves with diverse teams and capitalize on opportunities to hear and experiment with new ideas. They give themselves time to surface divergent thoughts and catalytic questions that ultimately lead to smarter business decisions.</p></div>",

        "content": "<p>APRIL 07, 2016 — Erica Dhawan — HBR</p><div>“Feeling pinned down?” read the message targeted at Pinterest employees. “This place driving you mad?” asked the clever riff aimed at Uber workers. If any story demonstrates how far employers will go in today’s fierce war for talent, the tale of Snapchat’s <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/kathleenchaykowski/2015/04/15/snapchat-sneakily-uses-its-own-app-to-poach-uber-engineers/#2715e4857a0b15c27f9b66d4\" target=\"_blank\">geofilter recruiting campaign</a> is it.</div><div><div><div><div><p>Last fall, Forbes reported that Snapchat had begun using geofilters (overlays that Snapchat users can put on top of images) in an attempt to poach employees from other top startups. Geofilters become available when a user is in a specific location — think Athens, Greece, or Morristown, New Jersey. Or, as it turns out, even the vicinity of 1455 Market Street, the address of Uber’s San Francisco headquarters. The geofilters combined amusing visuals and messages with the web address of Snapchat’s job page, all in the hope that a Twitter engineer taking a quick Snapchat break might come across the targeted “Fly Higher!” message and think, <em>Hey, maybe it’s time for a change.</em></p><p>The fight for new recruits is intense — not just in the tech sector, but across all industries. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), late 2015 was the <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shrm.org%2FResearch%2FMonthlyEmploymentIndices%2Fline%2FDocuments%2FLINE%2520January%25202016.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">most difficult hiring period in four years</a>. But as the Snapchat story establishes, connecting with today’s workforce no longer simply means going to the usual places and doing the usual things. These days, I advise Fortune 500 executives to treat talent as they would customers: Understand their behavior, and design recruiting strategies that meet them where they are. Following are three such innovative approaches for connecting with top talent.</p><h3><strong>Don’t keep relying on the same old social media platforms.</strong></h3><p>SHRM <a href=\"http://www.shrm.org/research/surveyfindings/pages/social-media-recruiting-screening-2015.aspx#sthash.RwpMGqn7.dpuf\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a> that 84% of organizations use social media for recruiting, and 82% of them use it primarily in the hunt for passive candidates. If so many companies are using social media, it must be effective, right? Well, not necessarily. What this high percentage means is that on the most popular social media platforms — LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter — you’re already vying with your competition for the same pool of expertise.</p><p>So venture out. Connect with other online platforms where people gather for the pleasure of sharing knowledge. For developers, that may be Stack Overflow, a question-and-answer site specifically for programmers. For the medical field, it may be Doximity, which 60% of U.S. physicians are members of. For Millennial women, it might be Levo or The Muse. For people in other professions, it may be Quora, a website that hosts questions and answers on subjects from programming languages to fashion to the outbreak of the Zika virus.</p><p>What’s the trick? It’s pretty straightforward: Go on a platform connected to the industry you’re recruiting for, and then look for people who are using the platform to have smart, relevant conversations. If you are impressed by someone’s questions, answers, or other posts, you may just have identified a potentially valuable employee.</p><p>At least one company has worked Quora specifically into its recruitment strategy. Highfive, a Silicon Valley–based video and web conferencing supplier, uses Quora to connect “with like-minded individuals.” The company was already developing content, targeted specifically at recruits, that demonstrated its “culture and the type of company we want to be in 1, 5, and 10 years.” By distributing this message through the Quora community, Highfive was “able to attract the type of people we want, and do it in an original way.” Such innovative solutions have paid off: Fortune magazine recently named Highfive to its list of the <a href=\"http://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces-in-technology/\" target=\"_blank\">10 Best Small Workplaces in Technology</a>.</p><h3><strong>Generate and nurture your own talent channels.</strong></h3><p>Genesys, a pioneer of customer experience and call center software, has offices across the globe, and it’s growing quickly, having acquired 10 companies since 2013. Part of its success is that the company supports a collaborative work environment and boasts transparent operations from the top down. But a few years ago, delays in signing new hires were impairing its expansion; in 2013, the average time to hire was 100 days.</p><p>Merijn te Booij, Genesys’s chief marketing officer, decided to stop waiting for the perfect candidate to appear though established channels. He partnered with HR to <a href=\"http://www.talenthq.com/2015/06/winning-the-war-for-talent-demands-creative-hiring-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\">start an associate program</a> that put new college and experienced professionals through an intensive three-week training, later pairing them with a mentor for ongoing counsel. Since 2014, Genesys has graduated nearly 70 associates from the United States, Africa, South Korea, Malaysia, and South America.</p><p>In addition, Genesys began actively networking to build a talent pool, and even organized a two-hour event to introduce high school students to the company’s products. Genesys staff plans to remain connected with these students, who may later return as interns or new hires upon graduation.</p><p>The results of these efforts have definitely paid off: In 2014, the average time to hire was 50 days — half the time of the previous year. Just one year later, Glassdoor named Genesys one of the <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.glassdoor.com%2FBest-Places-to-Work-2015-LST_KQ0%2C24.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Best Places to Work</a> for 2015.</p><h3><strong>Looking for Millennials? Address their specific concerns — and make it funny.</strong></h3><p>Poor Owen. In GE’s recent recruitment advertising campaign <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/agencyspy/ge-and-bbdo-know-exactly-whats-the-matter-with-owen/92849\" target=\"_blank\">“What’s the Matter with Owen?”</a> the fictional star couldn’t find anyone to share his excitement about his new job, a developer for GE. Everyone he knew was stuck in the same ideological rut: GE is a manufacturer, they thought, not a place to change the world.</p><div></div><p>At a surprise party, his friends struggle to maintain their masks of encouragement. At a backyard gathering, Owen is upstaged by a friend who will be working for an “app where you put fruit hats on animals.” In his family’s living room, his proud parents give him his “grandpappy’s” giant hammer.</p><p>GE knew that it had an image problem, one that was especially problematic for Millennials who value purpose over paycheck. The company needed to spread the message that, in fact, GE is involved in fascinating projects that will affect the world in positive ways. And what GE and its ad agency, BBDO, knew is that humor is one of the most effective ways to connect with this age group. In a 2013 online survey of 2,000 people born after 1981, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/business/media/comedy-central-survey-says-young-men-see-humor-as-essential.html\" target=\"_blank\">88% of people reported</a> that humor is essential to their sense of self. Tanya Giles, former executive vice president for research at MTV Networks, told the New York Times<em>,</em> “One big takeaway is that unlike previous generations, humor, and not music, is their No. 1 form of self-expression.”</p><p>The “What’s the Matter with Owen?” campaign premiered on the first episode of <em>The</em> <em>Late Show with Steven Colbert</em>, the perfect outlet to reach a demographic that prefers comedians to sports stars. Since then, the campaign has been viewed more than 800,000 times on YouTube.</p><p>As these examples show, connecting to top talent today is about reimagining the possibilities of leveraging all kinds of networks. It’s about connecting in the right places and with the right attitude. And while picking through the dense online tapestry may be daunting, remember you already employ a staff of experts. Current employees can tell you which sites they use to connect with like-minded individuals, and they can also help you to launch networks that are organized to meet your company’s specific needs.</p></div></div></div></div>",

        "content": "<p><em>Nicolas Sadirac, founder of School 42, speaks about 42 USA university. This American version of 42 Paris has been created and funded by the same team from France, and will be based in Fremont, California.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>What is the principle of the school 42?</strong></p><p>We take people from various backgrounds, regardless of their economic situation. We provide them with training which leads them to be operational and productive in three years. We transform them into innovative and collaborative programmers. Because today there is a critical lack of good programmers.</p><p>Today, the digital promotes creative economy. As the current system Reduces creativity by disciplining, it is cons-productive. We need creative people, and for That We must change the education system! In reality, this collective capacity to innovate, it comes from diversity Especially, both, in curriculum, age and social background. We require very different people to pool everything to blend Their skills. Then They issue Themselves And They create very disruptive things.</p><p>This is why 42 is free and Does not select on school diplomas or records. To enter, students must pass the test of the &#8220;swimming pool&#8221;, an obstacle race was to test the month Ability to work in teams and to find solutions, and Especially motivation. The problem with the current education system is That It is only suitable for a small proportion of people, and we believe That Those Who do not accordance to this system are idiots. To find new talents, we must first expand the selection criteria.</p><p></p><p><strong>It&#8217;s been three years since school 42 was created, since when have you been thinking about implementing it in the USA?</strong></p><p>We have been thinking about it from the beginning. The idea is that our students spend time in the USA. Thereafter we will also be installing a campus in Asia. Students must circulate. We identified the same problem in the US: a lack of good developers. From the beginning the idea was to allow movement of students. We must acculturate, mix cultures to create interesting dynamics.</p><p></p><p><strong>Are there major differences between US 42 and 42 French?</strong></p><p>The US 42 will be bigger, almost 3 times that of Paris. There will also be a dormitory, also free. But in terms of operation this is exactly the same. Everything works on the same servers, the same intranet.</p><p>We also saw that there was a problem with age, because we put a limit to 30 years. It hurts because it is considered a form of discrimination.</p><p></p><p><strong>Have you identified the cultural differences that involve adaptation?</strong></p><p>No, if we see major differences we will adapt to it. Our model already operates in Romania and South Africa, with local universities who use our platforms. And there is no problem in adapting our method.</p><p></p><p><strong>What vision do you have on the US education system?</strong> <strong>Its issues?</strong></p><p>It is clear that there is a problem with student debt. But it is a system that works for a long time, which has the same problem as the european systems. But it will adapt more quickly because it is a less centralized system, accreditation systems are less dogmatic, more focused on results. If universities want to change the rating system that will be easy. While in France it is more rigid, it will be complicated to reform the system.</p><p></p><p><strong>The principle of gratuitousness is an upheaval, is it going to launch a wave, or will there be resistance?</strong></p><p>It&#8217;s rather complicated, in reality many American universities could do without tuitions, with the sponsorship of the elders, but they keep it as a matter of commitment, it&#8217;s cultural. So I do not know how it will evolve, it will take time. But it is a system that will have difficulties to question itself. It works well, universities are solicited, the economy works well. They have a macro problem with debt, but the universities consider that it is not their problem.</p><p>But it is true that gratuitousness is disturbing in the US, everyone is convinced that there is a trap. There is a suspicion on free gratuitousness.</p><p></p><p><strong>You have no fear of a phenomenon of brain drain?</strong></p><p>Not at all, instead there has to be a movement. American students will also spend time in France, the same for Asians, the goal is to circulate. If a student is going to work 5 years in the US it creates value, diversity, ideas.

Later, I finally followed a special training at HEC and I founded a data analysis company, we made predictions from receipts.</p><p>Then I wanted to devote myself to a social cause, and I created in 2005 the association Zup de Co. At first, as I have observed that there was, at school, an inequality in the information on career opportunities, I wanted to showcase the talents of poor neighborhoods. Then, as people asked me what they could do to change things, I directed Zup de Co to tutoring.</p><p>The real social inequality between children, it occurs actually at home in the accompaniment of students after school and the help they receive for homework.</p><p>Often, parents of children failing at school were themselves failing at school, so it&#8217;s a vicious circle</p><p>So there are now 140,000 young people who leave school every year in France.</p><p>The idea is to identify children in need and develop monitoring tools. Take children with poor grades, then advance them.</p><p>Here, we support more than 2,000 students every day, in 40 middle schools.</p><p>But first, we must accompany over time, for 4 years, the entire middle school. We help with homework every evening, plus a one tutoring session of two hours a week.</p><p>Those who give the course are students in prestigious universities, which have been successful and give a few hours a month to help troubled youth.</p><p></p><p><strong>Teachers are students of prestigious universities, so you fight inequality by social diversity?</strong></p><p>Yes, it allows to discover a universe, there is a shared success. The first thing students do is to take the kids to visit their university campuses, to make them want to go there. Also there is no rule of authority, it is not the same relationship as with the teacher, it&#8217;s more like big brothers. There are more horizontality and more confidence.</p><p></p><p><strong>This social reproduction, is it because of system malfunctions?</strong></p><p>No, actually math exercises at middle school are not so simple. Help a child with homework is not so simple, and parents are often overwhelmed. Inequality happens when parents do not have the financial means or the time to help their children. Either they don’t feel competent, so they censor themselves and do not watch their children&#8217;s homework. Either they work and do not have time.</p><p>In the associative landscape the problem is that there is no entrepreneurial culture, no real measure of the impact of its action. I am setting up a monitoring of our action, we have an intranet that tracks the progress of each student, so I can have meaningful data on our results.</p><p>I am sure we can halve underachievement. All it would take is the commitment of 3% of university students.</p><p>Then we will have to act on the primary school. There are already very active associations in this area, such as &#8220;Read and write&#8221; founded by Alexander Jardin, where retirees read books to children.</p><p></p><p><strong>In fact the salvation of Education would be more by the mobilization of associations than by an overhaul of the system? Some say the system is deficient or defective, but you see the problem is not real?</strong></p><p>Yes, because the teachers are doing their job, but they are not sufficiently valued.</p><p>Today in France there was 7,000 middle schools, it is a system that works not too bad compared to the volume.</p><p>But there is a hierarchy problem, if we want to solve the problem we need real bosses in schools, which can take more autonomy to recruit their teachers, boost them, paying them more &#8230;</p><p>If you put more money in education, there will be more motivated teachers, so less school failure, so you will save on the security budget. There will be fewer young people in jail for example.</p><p>We must also develop as soon as possible the more manual occupations.</p><p>7 years ago, we were told that there was a revolution in the field of digital. So there was a need for skilled workers in this field. To do programming, you need computer experts development. But to work on the web, 2 years of study are enough.</p><p>So I created the web@cadémie with Epitech, who works in project mode. I a team of hopeless students, and now they all have very good wages.</p><p></p><p><strong>Digital brings new management models, as horizontality. This principle, is it adapted in Zup de Co? Is it applicable to education in general?</strong></p><p>In 10 years we&#8217;ll have a lot of digital tools. With adaptive learning, I can take a kid to the Baccalaureate without ever seeing a teacher of his life, with just a tablet.</p><p>At Zup de Co, when a teacher is absent, we take the class in the computer room, we put students on digital tools to make them work on exercises.</p><p>Also, we will look for former students from the middle school to speak about what they have done, what they could have changed.</p><p>Digital today will bring solutions to the isolation of students at home. With digital homework, we can follow the kids with the appropriate way.</p><p>We also have in France an extraordinary resource of more than 2 million students, who benefited from free school system, they could give two hours a month to help middle school students from a disadvantaged background. We could then reduce precariousness, delinquency, very fast.</p><p>I have great ambitions for Zup de Co, to turn things around.</p>",

His concerns, his processes and his deadlines no longer have any secrets for you and you know how much he relies on you to accompany him on the right track in his business developments.</p><p>How will you spend the summer days (weeks) of vacation you are about to take? Will you carry in your luggage all the burden of your client?</p><p>As a good professional, you have not waited until the last moment to realize that you will be gone and the relationship you have everyday with your partner was going to interrupt for a specified time.</p><p>This time will be short for you, who&rsquo;ve diserved it, but your customer will feel that you are leaving forever and greater will be the temptation to call you during your vacation. Out of sight, perhaps, but certainly not far from his thoughts.</p><p>How to make the most of this summer break? To begin, I see two keywords that will be crucial to achieve this:</p><ul><li>Dis-Connect: literally, it means stop relationships, no longer bind the elements together. It is still not necessary to hide as a hermit in a cave, lost at the end of the world, a little common sense and method will help you find the right formula to effectively organize this disconnection.</li><li>Un-Bend: your everyday life is made of work and requirements, and all that leads to tensions: nerve, physical, etc. The proposed relaxation is simple, it is to provide the means to alleviate the tensions surrounding (stress relief) and break pressure (relaxing break) to finally return to yourself.</li></ul><p><strong>Let it go!</strong></p><p>The company you are accompanying has very competent workers, and your expertise is a valuable support to internal resources, certainly, but you still remain an &ldquo;outsider&rdquo;. So for once, claim your externality and distance between you and your customer. And as you know you have made arrangements for your client not be found destitute in your absence, trust yourself and allow yourself to forget him!</p><p>This professional dis-connection will allow you to re-connect with yourself and those around you!</p><p>You decided to take a real vacation? Ask yourself the following questions: how do I manage my phone, my computer, my emails? Set some rules and stick to them!</p><p><strong>The word &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; does not have the same meaning when I&rsquo;m on vacation.</strong></p><p>Yes, you help your customer to define such a strategy, yes, you feed all the thinking around such IT infrastructure, yes, you build with him such project he has long believed in and that&rsquo;s true, in your absence, he will feel very lonely, helpless, perhaps even panic.</p><p>The business activity never stops for the holidays, everyone is well aware of it. It may even be that your client has become accustomed, with one of your predecessors or on a previous mission, to keep in constant contact, and even during his vacation, with his consultant. Are you willing to accept the same thing in the relationship you establish with your client? Finally, who will decide of your time of disconnection?</p><p>Indeed, you give a maximum of time and energy to clients who draw many benefits from the work you do together throughout the year! Thanks to you, they were able to overcome obstacles quickly. Now is the time to take care of you.</p><p><strong>Do not end up with the dead battery!</strong></p><p>It is now your turn to enjoy this time you&rsquo;re offering! It would be unfortunate to suffer from a &ldquo;burn-out&rdquo; during your holidays! Holidays are for relaxing, not to suffer all the little miseries that we have no time to manage every day when working. And then you are not always warned when &ldquo;burn-out&rdquo; happens: do you really want to consume yourself until there is literally nothing left to burn, or would you prefer to enjoy this period of relaxation, this proximity to those who are close to you, and the gentle rhythm of your days?</p><p>I offer some keys to get there calmly:</p><ul><li><strong>Personable, smartness, representation:</strong> to live without any fuss, enjoying simple, dis-organized relationships, without the hierarchical packaging, clothing or professional, governing each of your interventions. The idea is to find the essential, to enjoy every moment of simple pleasure &hellip;</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Rhythm</strong>: up late, slept late, or vice versa depending on your pleasures. The good time is the one that brings you pleasure. The question of time is particularly important here. Finally, be happy, in all areas of your life, it also means taking time for yourself, at the right time, simply.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Concentration</strong>: Read a good book rather than working on the last graph of a particular Powerpoint.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Ideas:</strong> of course your creativity is always awake, even on holiday, it&rsquo;s also one of the reasons why you excel in consulting. But what to do of those ideas that come at times when, frankly, you should not think about work? Apply rigorously a rule that would allow you not to work before being formally appointed. So, during your holiday, no mandate!</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Teach to alternate periods of stress and those of &ldquo;letting go&rdquo;.</strong> This alternation is vital to relieve pressure and return to your duties with renewed energy. It would finally a pity if you return to work without being able to recharge your batteries, because it is your energy that carries you throughout the year.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Prepare your return</strong>: stop working, that does not mean to interrupt and stop thinking. Give yourself a limited time each day to write on a notebook, or a computer memo, the points on which you will have to work on or ideas that you intend to suggest to your client on your return. But above all do it sparingly, or else you will not see the difference between your working days and your vacation days.</li></ul><p><strong>It&rsquo;s time to take your time!</strong></p><p>Among your tasks, you definitely have the responsibility to ensure compliance with deadlines for the company you are accompanying. Deadlines are, with costs and quality, an essential element for achieving the objective. So in your work schedule, I invite you to consider this disconnection period as a planned event: physically, it means that you will include in your P.E.R.T. (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) or W.B.S (Work Breakdown Structure) a neutralization time in the succession of tasks. Sometimes it is necessary, both in project management than in consulting, to materialize this time to explicitly include it in the conduct of missions.</p><p>Finally, during your holidays, you are no longer a &ldquo;suit and tie uniform&rdquo;, you are not a &ldquo;function&rdquo;. Allow yourself to just be yourself, without the rituals and codes that govern your business. Your professional identity would not be broken down if you were seen to on a beach, an ice cream in hand, in shorts and sandals!</p><p>I would say in conclusion that, for an experienced and responsible professional, holidays are a great opportunity to be perfectly imperfect!</p><p>Take time for yourself, and allow yourself, sometimes, to do nothing, without feeling guilty; it will rejuvenate you. Assume being human and have, as everyone, desires, needs, to enjoy to unplug, and focus on a subject that you sometimes forsake at the benefit of your clients: yourself!</p><h6>To contact Alexandra for a coaching face-to-face or by Skype, in English, Spanish or French:</h6><h6>Website: <a href=\"http://www.coachdubonheur.com\">http://www.coachdubonheur.com</a></h6><h6>Mail: alexandra@coachdubonheur.fr</h6><h6>Facebook: coachdubonheur</h6><h6>Youtube: coach du bonheur</h6>",

        "content": "<p>APRIL 12, 2016 — Ed Batista — HBR</p><div> My coaching clients have hard jobs with big responsibilities that generate lots of stress, and many of their spouses and partners have similarly demanding careers. And yet one of the most challenging experiences in their day doesn’t occur at work, but in the first 15 minutes after they arrive home and greet each other.</div><div><div><p>When that initial personal encounter at the end of the workday goes well, it can help both parties feel a sense of care and appreciation that helps them unwind and feel better prepared for the following day. And yet it so often goes <em>badly</em>, creating frustration and a sense of disappointment that can poison the rest of the evening. There are several factors that make this such a difficult situation for couples to navigate.</p><p><strong>Different needs. </strong>Both parties are likely to be in different mental and emotional states with differing sets of personal needs, and while this may seem self-evident, it’s striking how many couples forget this when they walk in the door. A common version of this is someone arriving home after a difficult day who needs some quiet and solitude before being ready to engage, only to meet a spouse or partner who arrived home earlier (or who spent the day there) and is eager to connect.</p><p>Even if both people arrive home simultaneously, they may have had vastly different experiences during the day–one person ran into a string of conflicts and had a terrible commute, while the other went from one triumph to another and enjoyed a peaceful journey home.</p><p>And even if both people had similar days, they may simply need very different things in response to those experiences. Some people need to talk about their workday with a supportive listener, while others need time for quiet reflection. Some people need entertainment, some need distraction, some need a drink, and some just need a hug.</p><p><strong>Different recovery times. </strong>Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin, has spent decades studying the relationship between our emotions and various brain structures and neurological systems. In his 2012 book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Life-Your-Brain-Live/dp/0452298881\" target=\"_blank\">The Emotional Life of Your Brain</a></em>, Davidson notes that people vary widely with regard to the speed with which we recover from adverse experiences. (Davidson calls this quality “resilience,” but I prefer “recovery time,” as I use the former term more broadly when discussing <a href=\"http://www.edbatista.com/2014/08/ignoring-bandits-and-building-resilience.html\" target=\"_blank\">our overall response to stress and challenges</a>.) Davidson’s research demonstrates that people with different recovery times even show different patterns of activity in their brains.</p><p>In practice, this means that someone who had an objectively horrible day at work may be in a good mood by the time they step out of the office, yet someone who encountered fewer challenges may still feel their impact well into the evening.</p><p>(While the disadvantages of an excessively slow recovery time are obvious, it’s important to note that faster recovery times aren’t always better. People who appear to recover extremely quickly from negative experiences may feel compelled to do so because they find the resulting feelings of distress and discomfort intolerable and need to distance themselves psychologically. As a consequence, it can be harder for them to learn from mistakes and setbacks, and they may find themselves out of step with those around them.)</p><p><strong>Different cultures</strong>. “Every relationship is a cross-cultural experience,” according to John Gottman, an eminent psychologist at the University of Washington whose research has focused on marriage and committed relationships. In <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Principia-Amoris-The-Science-Love/dp/041564156X\" target=\"_blank\">Principia Amoris: The New Science of Love</a></em>, Gottman writes, even “if we come from the same country, the same part of the country, the same race, and the same religion, we come from… families that have defined meaning in very different ways. When we build a relationship together, we must decide on our own meanings.”</p><p>But while couples may take the time to understand and evaluate their respective life goals and philosophies before embarking on a shared existence together, they rarely stop to think about the more mundane aspects of domestic life and what it means to build a cross-cultural relationship in those domains.</p><p>That’s why spouses and partners may have significantly different interpretations and expectations about what it means to “come home” and how people are expected to interact on such an occasion.</p><p>So what can we do?</p><div></div><p>First, recognize that these differences exist and legitimize them. It’s unrealistic and unhelpful for couples to expect that they’ll automatically be in sync when they arrive home. Different needs, different recovery times, and different cultures all combine to make it <em>more</em>likely rather than not that couples will be <em>out</em> of sync when they first encounter each other at the end of the workday.</p><p>Next, identify your needs as individuals and make time to talk about this issue as a couple (but not when you first walk in the door – set some time aside). This may seem like a trivial or even silly issue to take so seriously, and yet a consistent failure to recognize the importance of this encounter is precisely why so many couples find it so stressful. A little planning–and some candor about what you need–go a long way.</p><p>Finally, be aware that a degree of emotion management and <a href=\"http://www.edbatista.com/2011/07/self-monitoring.html\" target=\"_blank\">self-monitoring</a> can be particularly useful. We tend to approach our spouses and partners with the expectation that we can just “be ourselves,” without worrying about how we’ll be perceived or our impact on them. And yet a consequence of this approach is that we take all the interpersonal skills that we work so hard to apply as leaders and managers, and we throw them out the window as we get close to home, just when they’d be most useful.</p></div><div></div></div>",

        "content": "<p>JUNE 17, 2016 &mdash; Travis Bradberry &mdash; themuse.com</p><p>The typical workday is long enough as it is, and technology is making it even longer. When you do finally get home from a full day at the office, your mobile phone rings off the hook, and emails drop into your inbox from people who expect immediate responses.</p><p>While most people claim to disconnect as soon as they get home, recent research says otherwise. A study conducted by the American Psychological Association found that more than 50% of us check work email before and after work hours, throughout the weekend, and even when we&rsquo;re sick. Even worse, 44% of us check work email while on vacation.</p><p>A Northern Illinois University study that came out this summer shows just how bad this level of connection really is. The study found that the expectation that people need to respond to emails during off-work hours produces a prolonged stress response, which the researchers named &ldquo;telepressure.&rdquo; Telepressure ensures that you are never able to relax and truly disengage from work. This prolonged state of stress is terrible for your health. Besides increasing your risk of heart disease, depression, and obesity, stress decreases your cognitive performance.</p><p>We need to establish boundaries between our personal and professional lives. When we don&rsquo;t, our work, our health, and our personal lives suffer.</p><p>Responding to emails during off-work hours isn&rsquo;t the only area in which you need to set boundaries. You need to make the critical distinction between what belongs to your employer and what belongs to you and you only. The items that follow are yours. If you don&rsquo;t set boundaries around them and learn to say no to your boss, you&rsquo;re giving away something with immeasurable value.</p><h2>1. Your Health</h2><p>It&rsquo;s difficult to know when to set boundaries around your health at work because the decline is so gradual. Allowing stress to build up, losing sleep, and sitting all day without exercising all add up. Before you know it, you&rsquo;re rubbing your aching back with one hand and your zombie-like eyes with the other, and you&rsquo;re looking down at your newly acquired belly. The key here is to not let things sneak up on you, and the way you do that is by keeping a consistent routine. Think about what you need to do to keep yourself healthy (taking walks during lunch, not working weekends, taking your vacations as scheduled), make a plan, and stick to it no matter what. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re allowing your work to overstep its bounds.</p><h2>2. Your Family</h2><p>It&rsquo;s easy to let your family suffer for your work. Many of us do this because we see our jobs as a means of maintaining our families. We have thoughts such as &ldquo;I need to make more money so that my kids can go to college debt-free.&rdquo; Though these thoughts are well-intentioned, they can burden your family with the biggest debt of all&mdash;a lack of quality time with you. When you&rsquo;re on your deathbed, you won&rsquo;t remember how much money you made for your spouse and kids. You&rsquo;ll remember the memories you created with them.</p><h2>3. Your Sanity</h2><p>While we all have our own levels of this to begin with, you don&rsquo;t owe a shred of it to your employer. A job that takes even a small portion of your <a href=\"http://www.talentsmart.com/about/emotional-intelligence.php\" target=\"_blank\">sanity</a> is taking more than it&rsquo;s entitled to. Your sanity is something that&rsquo;s difficult for your boss to keep track of. You have to monitor it on your own and set good limits to keep yourself healthy. Often, it&rsquo;s your life outside of work that keeps you sane. When you&rsquo;ve already put in a good day&rsquo;s (or week&rsquo;s) worth of work and your boss wants more, the most <a href=\"http://www.talentsmart.com/products/\" target=\"_blank\">productive</a> thing you can do is say no, and then go and enjoy your friends and hobbies. This way, you return to work refreshed and de-stressed. You certainly <em>can</em> work extra hours if you want to, but it&rsquo;s important to be able to say no to your boss when you need time away from work.</p><h2>4. Your Identity</h2><p>While your work is an important part of your identity, it&rsquo;s dangerous to allow your work to become your whole identity. You know you&rsquo;ve allowed this to go too far when you reflect on what&rsquo;s important to you and work is all that (or most of what) comes to mind. Having an identity outside of work is about more than just having fun. It also helps you relieve stress, grow as a person, and avoid burnout.</p><h2>5. Your Contacts</h2><p>While you do owe your employer your best effort, you certainly don&rsquo;t owe him or her the contacts you&rsquo;ve developed over the course of your career. Your contacts are a product of your hard work and effort, and while you might share them with your company, they belong to you.</p><h2>6. Your Integrity</h2><p>Sacrificing your integrity causes you to experience massive amounts of stress. Once you realize that your actions and beliefs are no longer in alignment, it&rsquo;s time to make it clear to your employer that you&rsquo;re not willing to do things his or her way. If that&rsquo;s a problem for your boss, it might be time to part ways.</p><h2>Bringing it All Together</h2><p>Success and fulfillment often depend upon your ability to set good boundaries. Once you can do this, everything else just falls into place.</p>",

The farm was then attached to the Palace of Versailles by Louis 14. Then after the French Revolution it was taken over by the state.</p><p>Then in the 1930’s, the Laureau family was asked by the State to manage and restore the farm. From that time, the family has been renting the farm. They are still now managers and shareholders.</p><p>This moment marks the diversification of farm activities and Gally brand. In the 60s, our business selling ornamental plants, a retail outlet at the time, inspired a new business, including the landscaping of these plants. The brand Les Jardins de Gally was born. Nowadays, we both are farmers and gardeners. On the one hand, we welcome Parisians at the farm &#8211; in the country living shop, the educational farms and the pick-your-own kitchen garden. On the other hand, we cultivate several forms of nature into cities, especially in companies, in France and abroad. This main branch, representing 80% of the income, is made up with the design office, the building and maintenance of indoor and outdoor gardens, terraces, living walls and roofs, but also weekly and daily services such as cut flowers decoration, fresh fruits delivery, etc.</p><p>To sum up with, we are farmers, gardeners, florists and &#8220;fruitists&#8221;! Several brands, each with its core skills, form this tree: Le Bureau d&#8217;Études de Gally, Les Vergers de Gally, Manière &amp; Descamps, etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>How was the trend of corporate gardens born?</strong></p><p>Initially, gardens were mostly for individuals. Then there was a company that wanted to rent plants. Dominique Laureau decided to capitalize on the business toward companies. Gally took the market niche of inner landscape, with open or closed atriums, patios &#8230; So nothing new from this point of view, we are doing gardens for companies for over 30 years. But today there is a new craze, we talk about corporate gardens. So the context has moved, there is a societal demand, a political marketing, greening is often used as a campaign argument. So it can be a banner for companies too.</p><p>But what has really changed in the approach to corporate gardens, is that today we want to give meaning to the place of plants, which are not only an ornament.</p><p>The second quality of life factor in the company, after the mission and the management mode, it is the environment. The question that has arisen is what are the functions that the plant can perform, and how to contextualize it so that it can fulfill these functions.</p><p>Previously, the fashion was to put a plant for each corridor. But it did not really make sense, the location of the plant was not thoughtful. So we analyzed the path of the employee in the company, we analyzed the function of each space in the company, and we wondered how plants could amplify this function and give it meaning.</p><p>For example, today, break spaces, friendly spaces for employees, are more developed. Whereas before only the ceremonial spaces like the lobby were well appointed. Besides, it is more and more common to take foreign partners or clients in the break area, this is a way to get him into the family. Conversely, entrance halls are becoming more and more spaces of life and conviviality.</p><p></p><p><strong>What are the benefits of plants for a company?</strong></p><p>The plant should provide a work environment where people feel good. But for that, the plant has to be suitable for the activity and the identity of the company. That&#8217;s why we created the study office of Gally, a consulting firm dedicated to the analysis of the needs of a company. You have to see the revegetation of the company premises as a service. If the general management or human resource management are invested in the project, it can be something very personal, which will strengthen the identity of the company and create membership for employees.</p><p>Corporate gardens are returns on investment difficult to quantify. But there are studies that have been made. <a href=\"http://www.terrapinbrightgreen.com/report/economics-of-biophilia/\">The Economics of Biophilia</a>, for example, gives 10% less absenteeism in a vegetated environment.</p><p>Plants can be used for their soothing properties. We live in very connected spaces, and plant expresses a slowdown. The plant creates disconnection spaces which ultimately help improve performance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Today the corporate vegetable garden is a big trend, can it enhance the collaborative dynamic by making employees work together in the garden?</strong></p><p>We kept a vegetable garden in a company for more than three years. We originally designed the garden with a core group of motivated employees. A condition of the garden is to make this space a catalyst, and those who run it must communicate. And resources are shared at times open to all. This is an opportunity to strengthen cohesion, transversality and internal communication.</p><p>At first our own teams dealt a lot with the vegetable garden, employees who were working on it were very supervised. Then the second year we let them do by themselves. But they got more careless. The idea is to create specific times, such as workshops, where everyone can work together in the garden.</p><p>We more and more often do educational workshops in companies, for example on biological protection (insects which protects plants) or making bouquets with local flowers. It was always very successful. This is an opportunity for employees to communicate with other employees they do not meet usually.</p><p></p><p><strong>How do you think that the relationship to plants will evolve? How do you see cities of the future?</strong></p><p>There is a global trend to move closer to nature. It is understood as a necessity. In Chinese megacities, in Shanghai or Beijing, greenhouses are considered protected from pollution. They thus become crowded living spaces, like agoras. The plant has a tendency to reinvest the city, with new methods of soilless culture, landscape and plant design. With biomimetics, city buildings are inspired from vegetal forms.</p><p>Urban agriculture is also a strong trend, with hubs that bring together the supply of traditional agriculture and urban agriculture, which has a more social function. This is a major territorial issue because many peri-urban lands can be redeveloped into spaces that combine housing and agriculture, as there is also a strong need for housing.</p><p>Finally, the future also consists in the development of circular economy. Urban agriculture favours recycling waste as fertilizer, or raising animals, such as chickens, for the management of household waste.</p><p>I think that future cities will rejoin the living, organic. This implies putting in interdependance several disciplines.</p>",

She was the director of a Paris 5 university research centre in epidemiology and policy design in mental health which trains PhD students. She has extensive experience in psychiatric epidemiology and has been responsible for mental health surveys on large population samples in diverse places.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong> </strong><strong>What is your background ?</strong></p><p>I am a psychiatrist, I do research and teaching. I am specialized in psychiatric epidemiology, I was trained in Canada, in a research center. Then I returned to France.</p><p>I made inquiries about mental health and social factors, I have worked on burnout in the teaching profession. I created a public health research foundation. I worked at EHESP. I have led there the department of epidemiology and biostatistics. As director of the department and psychiatrist, I have worked on suicide at work.</p><p>I have participated in the public debate about burnout in France. I was interviewed by the National Assembly and the trade unions. And I position against the grain of public opinion.</p><p></p><p><strong>The recognition of burnout is relatively recent. What is the situation? What is your position on this?</strong></p><p>The psychiatric point of view, according to the international literature on the subject, is that the concept of burnout is built on very fragile science. In fact, there are many people who are in depression, but causality with work is absolutely not proven. But the notion of burnout is a magical object, a solution that has a great success because it disempowers the employee by shifting the blame on the company. This concept is a creation, and I see the enthusiasm for this concept as a fad.</p><p>But as the media and even governments take burnout seriously, it is a problem. Because companies are convicted for things that are not their responsibility. Today, in France for example, the law debate for recognition of burnout as an occupational disease, but this is a mistake. In the country where this has been done they are trying to reduce the diagnostic of burnout. Of course we have to improve working conditions and companies who have not good management practices should be pressed to change . But burnout recognition is not the solution and this concept does not exist from the medical perspective..</p><p></p><p><strong>So if an employee has psychological disorders, these are personal more than professional?</strong></p><p>Being unhappy at work, it&#8217;s possible. Work may not be done to entertain. Work imposes constraints on individuals. At all levels there are stresses and annoyances.</p><p>To compartmentalize work and personal life, it is a figment of the imagination. If someone is not well at work, he is not well at home either, that&#8217;s what the data show. There is a problem with the causality attributed to the problem.</p><p>From the scientific point of view, risk attributable to work is when a problem could happen to anyone in the same position at work because of the work constraints. But this is not true for depression or suicide, for example. In these cases, the determining element comes from the person, from a psychological fragility which is multifactorial including some genetic or familial determinisms. According to this definition, suicide and clinical depression are not psycho-social risks because the part of the individual is too important versus that on of the work situation. It is a mistake to place the blame on the company only. In what concerns mental health, causality is a complicated thing.</p><p></p><p><strong>What do you think would be the things to do?</strong></p><p>Quite often for ideological reasons, we imagine that anyone can do every job, but it&#8217;s not the case.it is on the human resources management to fit the person and the task and to the managers to properly attribute tasks according to the ability of the employees however this is difficult to obtain because of the external pressures but some succeed better than others.</p><p>The problem with the notion of psychosocial risks is that it makes the employer liable for employee&#8217;s psychological problems, then that is an irruption of personal problems into working life. The worst part is that the method chosen for managing psychosocial risks creates tensions between employers and employees, because it recreates a social struggle scheme. In this kind of climate, the concept of burnout or psychosocial risks is perverted and turned into a weapon.</p><p>In such a climate of mistrust, people maintain a paranoia that prevents cooperation. It&#8217;s the same for suicide at work. In France, there was in 2011 a political and media frenzy on a wave of suicide at France Telecom. But this wave has never existed, the number of suicides in this period did not exceed the average, all the experts and statisticians say it. As a consequence suicide at work has been viewed as a sort of indicator of an enterprise indicator for good working conditions and equated to psycho social risks when in fact what has to be used for preventing suicide is not the same than what should be used to prevent psychosocial risks. This is a genuine problem because increasing well being at work will not decrease suicide which is rather linked to the presence of mental disorders that has been treated properly medically and socially by decreasing the stigma attached to it. The problem is that the authorities and the media system have great theories, but they are not based on scientific studies, they do not even read it. There is not enough pragmatism.</p><p>In fact, according to these studies, those people said victims of &#8220;burn-out&#8221; are mostly clinically depressed and may not be treated properly. We should not mix the field of work and the field of mental health. This confusion does not contribute at all to the victims&#8217; health, because their pathology is not recognized as such and the sick person could be used in combats that may be important but have to be lead on the adequate field.</p>",

Several, like Homejoy, have recently gone bankrupt. Others have had to pivot to find a more sustainable business model. It turns out it&rsquo;s not so easy to offer your clients quality on-demand workers for a very low price: many workers will just not show up where they are expected. Angry users will never return and seek other alternatives.</p><p><em>When you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.</em> The sporadic nature of these low-paid gigs makes it impossible for many of these platforms to win the loyalty of the workers. Uber and TaskRabbit are accused of exploiting unqualified workers by offering low pay and no durable work prospects, when they should provide job security and better pay. There is a judicial battle in the US to have Uber drivers (contract workers) qualified as full employees, because, so goes the argument, you can&rsquo;t be an independent worker if you are entirely dependent on one company.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*bhOqnBKkK9nVQwuHzbZ5WQ.png\" data-width=\"480\" data-height=\"360\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"55\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*bhOqnBKkK9nVQwuHzbZ5WQ.png\" alt=\"Platforms: An Amazing Opportunity For The Creative Class\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*bhOqnBKkK9nVQwuHzbZ5WQ.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>The rise of platforms such as Uber has opened up an entire new field for litigation: are self-employed drivers in fact employees?</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>And yet, platforms aren&rsquo;t doomed. Some of them will change their models and ultimately offer workers better work conditions and higher pay if they want to serve their customers at the highest level of quality and scale. Others may even end up offering workers employee contracts if it&rsquo;s the best way to increase quality and economic viability. When it comes to creative class workers &mdash; consultants and architects, for example &mdash; the platformization of work has only just begun. Its development will unleash tremendous new opportunities, produce troughs of new work options and markets. Squeeze the middleman and you&rsquo;ll get more demand on one side and more offer on the other. Lower prices and higher pay. Can online platforms really do what corporations can&rsquo;t do? Well, nobody says it&rsquo;s easy, but it sure is possible.</p><h4><strong>The gig economy is redefining work as we know it</strong></h4><p>The platformization of work causes us to question the very meaning of work, employment, work relationships, insurance and the role of the state to protect a country&rsquo;s workers. As <a href=\"http://www.nickgrossman.is/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.nickgrossman.is/\">Nick Grossman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.elizabethwoyke.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.elizabethwoyke.com/\">Elizabeth Woyke</a> explain in their widely-discussed paper &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\"><em>Serving Workers in the Gig Economy</em></a>&rdquo;, the gig economy has completely unbundled the benefits and protections that have traditionally come with full-time employment, which means that &ldquo;<em>the different components of a job &mdash; income, structure, social connections, meaning, access to healthcare &mdash; which used to be bound together, are now becoming available from different places</em>&rdquo;.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*pa0AgyKQGvkOc9nMKX66IQ.png\" data-width=\"394\" data-height=\"194\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*pa0AgyKQGvkOc9nMKX66IQ.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*pa0AgyKQGvkOc9nMKX66IQ.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>Nick Grossman &amp; Elizabeth Woyke, authors of a landmark paper</em></figcaption></figure><p>The platformization of work, with the emergence of web and mobile marketplaces and work platforms such as Amazon&rsquo;s Mechanical Turk, <a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.upwork.com/\">UpWork</a> (the freelancer marketplace), and on-demand service platforms like Uber, Handy and Doctor on Demand, has accelerated the shift in the past 2 to 3 years.</p><p>Knowledge-based work is only now undergoing the same redefinition. It used to be that only writers and artists were free of the constraints of nine-to-five work days. Artists can&rsquo;t possibly be managed like regular workers. So instead of selling their brawn to a company, they sell their creations or performances on a gig basis to whoever will pay the price. What&rsquo;s new is that more traditional non-artistic professions are now following the same pattern: accountants, for example, have the job that most people would think is the least &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; job there can be (which is debatable), but they too can increasingly &lsquo;gigify&rsquo; their work on digital platforms. And they have a lot to gain from it!</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*j7jDJ2C7V52Dhk27fQ9R4g.png\" data-width=\"1058\" data-height=\"829\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*j7jDJ2C7V52Dhk27fQ9R4g.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*j7jDJ2C7V52Dhk27fQ9R4g.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*j7jDJ2C7V52Dhk27fQ9R4g.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>A study by Freelancers Union and Upwork revealed the prevalence of freelancing in the US</em></figcaption></figure><p>The gig economy now concerns a growing part of the US workforce. According to a <a href=\"https://www.upwork.com/press/2015/10/01/freelancers-union-and-upwork-release-new-study-revealing-insights-into-the-almost-54-million-people-freelancing-in-america/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.upwork.com/press/2015/10/01/freelancers-union-and-upwork-release-new-study-revealing-insights-into-the-almost-54-million-people-freelancing-in-america/\">study by Freelancers Union and UpWork</a>, in 2015, 54 million Americans &mdash; more than one third of the working population! &mdash; participated in some form of freelance work, often combined with salaried work. This huge number includes workers with all kinds of qualifications. Some are very well-paid. Others aren&rsquo;t. Some juggle different jobs. Others don&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s certain is that the trend is here to stay and is forcing us to question everything we take for granted.</p><h4><strong>Platforms really do make the cake bigger for low-qualified workers</strong></h4><p>For low-qualified workers, who go from gig to gig and sometimes can&rsquo;t make ends meet, platforms like Handy or Uber don&rsquo;t provide an easy life. But without digital platforms their situation would be worse. There is just more work because of these platforms. Corporations have been reducing their reliance on full-time workers for a long time, but the development of the work platforms has made it easier for them to offer more work than before, work that would previously have been performed by overworked employees or would not have been offered at all. As work can be unbundled into different tasks, in many shapes and sizes, there is less reluctance to hire a contract worker to perform a given task. Thus a wide array of new jobs and tasks can easily be offered that would otherwise not have existed.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*q9QW_uQj09uf-97cl2CBuA.png\" data-width=\"785\" data-height=\"675\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*q9QW_uQj09uf-97cl2CBuA.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"62\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*q9QW_uQj09uf-97cl2CBuA.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*q9QW_uQj09uf-97cl2CBuA.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>Uber&rsquo;s powerful network effects, as drawn by Yammer founder David Sacks</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Entire markets have been created or have expanded exponentially. Uber was obviously bad news for the taxi industries in large cities. But what Uber has proven is that the market for chauffeured transportation was infinitely bigger than the taxi market in these cities, big enough for hundreds of thousands of new drivers. <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2015/05/01/the-numbers-behind-ubers-exploding-driver-force/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2015/05/01/the-numbers-behind-ubers-exploding-driver-force/\">Hundreds of thousands!</a>There are clearly many poorer passengers the taxis could never target. The network effects of two-sided markets simply expanded the existing market enormously&mdash;and could have expanded it even more were it not for restricting regulations.</p><h4><strong>Platforms contribute to market transparency for better worker revenues</strong></h4><p>Founded in 2015, <a href=\"http://dispatcher.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://dispatcher.com/\">Dispatcher</a> is a new app that matches gig workers with jobs. Its cofounders want to build a real-time labor exchange for the gig economy, similar to an ad exchange, to empower the on-demand workforce. It mediates the relationship between the worker and the work platform and serves as an &lsquo;agent&rsquo; for the worker, helping him/her make the best decisions about where and when to work. As Robert Yau, <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\">Dispatcher&rsquo;s founder explains</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our vision in the future is to potentially predict what are the best jobs based on location and time. So workers can pick and choose, essentially. It Uber&rsquo;s paying me $20/hour while Postmaster, because it&rsquo;s dinner, is paying me $30/hour, a worker may decide to do Postmates rather than Uber. Today, they don&rsquo;t have that visibility. The thinking is that, with Dispatcher, when we become the labor exchange, that visibility will get exposed&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*q15wSftaDWzdqzZYtx3tvQ.png\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"333\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"47\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*q15wSftaDWzdqzZYtx3tvQ.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*q15wSftaDWzdqzZYtx3tvQ.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>Robert Yau, the founder of Dispatcher.com</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h4>The critical vision of Dispatcher is that price transparency can be brought to the marketplace, to the benefit of the worker!</h4><p>Platforms have made it possible for middle-class individuals to increase their revenues when these revenues had been stagnating or declining for decades. A large part of the independent contractors who find work on those platforms already have full-time or part-time jobs but want to or need to work more to increase their revenues. As is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-class_squeeze\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-class_squeeze\">now well-documented</a>, the revenues of middle-class Westerners have declined over the last two decades. To simply make ends meet, most people need to be very creative. The many platforms of the digital economy have made gigs and property-sharing sources of revenue (renting the things you own, as with Airbnb) easily available.</p><p>For highly-qualified workers, digital platforms offer the promise of a just reward. Good ratings and reviews can make a profile more attractive for a company seeking talent. Why rely on an old-fashioned CV if one can actually prove one&rsquo;s worth online? It is naturally critical for the workers to have control over their data. Data portability (from one platform to the other) is a big issue worth fighting for. And leaving the right digital traces is a skill worth acquiring.</p><h4><strong>There is now a whole new ecosystem of services for workers</strong></h4><p>AsNick Grossman and Elizabeth Woyke show in <a href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.oreilly.com/iot/free/serving-workers-gig-economy.csp\"><em>Serving Workers in the Gig Economy</em></a><em>, t</em>hese services all have a common theme, &ldquo;<em>the desire to retain the flexibility and freedom of gig work, while obtaining the protections and benefits of traditional full-time work</em>&rdquo;. So independent workers can have their cake and eat it too. The main difficulty about being a freelancer (without a salaried work on the side) was access to benefits and protections. The safety net &mdash; benefits such as unemployment, disability and retirement &mdash; bundled with work, is part of a package that&rsquo;s invisible&hellip; and taken for granted. But there are new kinds of insurance products that address freelancers. For example, <a href=\"http://www.peers.org/product/freelancers-union-national-benefits-platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.peers.org/product/freelancers-union-national-benefits-platform/\">Peers</a> offers a program of portable benefits that stay with the worker regardless of employer. <a href=\"https://even.me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://even.me/\">Even</a> offers a banking product that helps hourly workers manage the ups and downs of an unpredictable work schedule and income.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*aqCjbehB3F5-AAalZJz4bA.png\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*aqCjbehB3F5-AAalZJz4bA.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"40\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aqCjbehB3F5-AAalZJz4bA.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*aqCjbehB3F5-AAalZJz4bA.png\" /></div></div></figure><h4><strong>For the creative class, platforms are an amazing opportunity</strong></h4><p>Highly-qualified workers have embraced the gig economy with enthusiasm. A higher number of the so-called &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo; are happy to escape the &ldquo;prison&rdquo; of salaried work. Take programmers. They&rsquo;re in such high demand that they welcome the opportunity to become independent and get paid more. For those who work fast, it&rsquo;s easier to combine multiple jobs, and leave the jobs that are less exciting. HR people will have to learn the right ways to appeal to the best freelance talent: offer them flexibility and exciting projects.</p><p>The &ldquo;Creative Class&rdquo; is a socioeconomic class identified by American economist Richard Florida. According to him, creative class workers are a key force for economic development of post-industrial cities in the developed world. In the US, they represent 30% of the total workforce. They are made of two groups:</p><ul><li>the &ldquo;super creative core&rdquo; (12% of all US jobs) includes scientists, engineers, programmers, researchers, professors, artists and designers. Their primary function is to be creative and innovative. They find the problems and solve them.</li><li>the &lsquo;creative professionals&rsquo; are the classic knowledge-based workers who work in business, finance, healthcare, legal or education. They solve specific problems.</li></ul><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*cmHss28yNbkPcqNrpMQXHQ.png\" data-width=\"400\" data-height=\"345\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"62\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*cmHss28yNbkPcqNrpMQXHQ.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*cmHss28yNbkPcqNrpMQXHQ.png\" /></div></div></figure><p>Both the super creative core and the creative professionals have long enjoyed more autonomy and flexibility in their work. Some professions (like lawyers and doctors) were traditionally independent workers, but others among the creative professionals have long been the employees of big corporations which act as middlemen between problems and problem solvers.</p><p>Consultants are a case in point. For a hundred years, big consulting firms have hired young creative talent to solve their clients&rsquo; specific problems. Their model has consisted in overcharging companies for the consulting services of junior consultants. That worked quite well because these young consultants could just copy-paste the work of their elders. Alas, fewer companies today accept to pay so much for copy-paste work. More of them demand customized services by experienced workers. So the model is coming to a halt. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean consulting is dead! Indeed they can increasingly sell their services directly to the companies that need them. Algorithms can match the right workers with the companies that require their specific skills.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*aFA6Ry8GMJTu5mMuvRDDcg.png\" data-width=\"732\" data-height=\"452\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*aFA6Ry8GMJTu5mMuvRDDcg.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"45\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*aFA6Ry8GMJTu5mMuvRDDcg.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*aFA6Ry8GMJTu5mMuvRDDcg.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>HourlyNerd co-founders Patrick Petitti, Rob Biederman</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>New platforms have emerged that offer to connect qualified workers directly with the companies (or people) whose problems need to be solved. For example, HourlyNerd is a Boston-based global online marketplace that connects big and small companies with over 20,000 independent business consultants for project-based work. Clients post projects, receive bids, select experts and make payment on the platform. Another example of a platform on which high-skilled workers offer their services is CoContest, which is known as the &lsquo;Uber of interior designers&rsquo;. (Funnily enough, a majority of the designers who participate in the contests on the website are Italian.)</p><h4><strong>Let&rsquo;s make sure we play our cards right if we want to get more work</strong></h4><p>First let&rsquo;s not kid ourselves about the ability of some of these gigantic platforms to become predators. If every gig worker is a small company, then identity and personal reputation are their brand and professional card. If so much is mediated by platforms, it it critical that the workers control their data. Reputation gained on one platform could be used to obtain income from another platform. So data portability would give workers more flexibility to choose where and how to work. Right now, by default, the data generated is the property of the platform rather than that of the worker. Mature platforms prefer to keep their users&rsquo; reputation value within their own system, which will only increase the winner-take-all trend towards gigantism. It&rsquo;s important to make data portability an issue and favor the small newer platforms that use data portability as an argument.</p><figure><div><div data-image-id=\"1*lq--EFpgNuRW5gUYkz2gLA.png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"533\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*lq--EFpgNuRW5gUYkz2gLA.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"47\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*lq--EFpgNuRW5gUYkz2gLA.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*lq--EFpgNuRW5gUYkz2gLA.png\" /></div></div><figcaption><em>With the Next: Economy conference, Tim O&rsquo;Reilly (left) tackles the challenge of stressing the advantages of platforms from the workforce&rsquo;s point of view</em></figcaption></figure><p>Second let&rsquo;s make policymakers aware of the value that work platforms can have for workers. Lobbying and raising awareness is critical to have governments on the side of gig workers. Rather than <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/uber-suspends-controversial-uberpop-france-103700420.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/uber-suspends-controversial-uberpop-france-103700420.html\">banning</a> the platforms, they could incentivize platforms to adopt a model with more protections. Work platforms opt toward a model of independent contractors because of the transactional costs and friction of the employment paperwork. If these burdensome and costly processes could be made into digital, instant, API-driven processes, then there could be more protections from the start!</p><p>On a more individual level, we need to embrace what amounts to a paradigm shift. Deconstructing work as we have always known it (in companies) is scary. But platforms will be a boon if we play our cards right. Let&rsquo;s choose the right platforms and boost our work prospects!</p><figure><div><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2-2-300x225.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 527px) 100vw, 527px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2-2-300x225.png 300w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2-2-768x576.png 768w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2-2.png 800w\" alt=\"426cff1f-6a5e-43e0-8b23-085cb5420de2 2\" width=\"527\" height=\"395\" /></div></figure></div>",

        "content": "<p></p><p>MAY 31, 2016 – Travis Bradberry – entrepreneur.com</p><p>There are so many things that can kill the careers of good, hard-working people. Honest mistakes often carry hard-hitting consequences.</p><p>We usually only hear about the more egregious examples, such as when Yelp employee Talia Jane became an Internet sensation last month for writing a blistering post criticizing the company’s low pay and its CEO. To no one’s surprise, she quickly found herself out of a job.</p><p>Most people don’t go down in a blaze of glory like Talia Jane; they kill their careers in subtle, decidedly undramatic ways. And it’s a shame because it happens all the time.</p><p>A recent survey by VitalSmarts found that 83 percent of people had seen someone make a blunder that had catastrophic results for their career, reputation, or business, and 69 percent admitted that they themselves had done something that had damaged their careers:</p><ul><li>31 percent said it cost them a promotion, a raise, or even a job</li><li>27 percent said it damaged a working relationship</li><li>11 percent said it destroyed their reputation</li></ul><p>These numbers show how damaging you can be to your own career if you’re not careful. There doesn’t have to be a single, sickening moment when you realize that you just shoved your foot firmly in your mouth, either. Little things can add up over time and undermine your career just as much as (or more than) one huge lapse in judgment. The good news is that if you stay aware of them, these are all things that you can control before they creep up on you and kill your career.</p><h2><strong>1. Over-promising and under-delivering.</strong></h2><p>It’s tempting to promise the moon to your colleagues and your clients, especially when you’re honest and hardworking and believe that you can do it. The problem is that there’s no point in creating additional pressure that can make you look bad. If you promise to do something ridiculously fast and you miss the deadline by a little bit, you’ll likely think that you did a good job because you still delivered quickly. But the moment you promise something to someone, they expect nothing less. You end up looking terrible when you fall short, which is a shame, because you could have done the same quality work in the same amount of time with great results if you’d just set up realistic expectations from the beginning. This is one of those situations where perception matters more than reality. Don’t deliberately undershoot your goals; just be realistic about the results you can deliver so that you’re certain to create expectations that you will blow out of the water.</p><h2><strong>2. Complacency.</strong></h2><p>How long has it been since you proactively learned a new skill, reached out to your networking contacts, or even polished up your resume? If you can’t remember, you might have become a bit complacent, and complacency is a real career killer. It’s what happens when you’re just along for the ride and assume that nothing will ever change. But we’ve seen enough disruption &#8213; technological and otherwise &#8213; over the last few years to realize that change is inevitable. If you’re always too busy to learn something new or to expand your network, you’ve got your priorities mixed up. However, if you make continuous growth and development a priority, you’ll be ready for whatever comes your way.</p><h2><strong>3. Fear of change.</strong></h2><p>Fear of <a href=\"http://www.talentsmart.com/products/\" target=\"_blank\">change</a> is complacency’s evil twin. It actively works to keep things the same. I’m sure you’ve seen this one first hand at work when someone uttered the dreaded words, “But we’ve always done it this way.” Things are changing too fast these days to latch on so tightly to the status quo, and the costs of doing so can be huge. In one survey, 91 percent of respondents said that the most successful employees are the ones who can adapt to the changing workplace. Change is a constant part of our lives, both personally and professionally. It doesn’t matter whether you think things should change or whether you prefer the old ways &#8213; change just is. You don’t have to learn to love it, but you do have to learn to stop resisting it and to start adapting to it.</p><p></p><h2><strong>4. Having an inflatable ego</strong><strong>.</strong></h2><p>Did you ever work with someone who had a string of successes and started thinking that they were the be-all and end-all of superstardom? Success is great. It definitely boosts your career, and it feels really, really good. The problems start once you let it go to your head. You start thinking that success is going to last forever and that you’re entitled to it. Never, ever be content with resting on your laurels. Once you start thinking that you’re the cat’s meow, you’re setting yourself up for very painful failure.</p><h2><strong>5. Losing sight of the big picture. </strong></h2><p>It’s easy to become head-down busy, working so hard on what’s right in front of you that you lose sight of the big picture. But smart people learn how to keep this in check by weighing their daily priorities against a carefully calculated goal. It’s not that they don’t care about small-scale work; they just have the discipline and perspective to adjust their course as necessary. Life is all about the big picture, and when you lose sight of it, everything suffers.</p><div></div><h2><strong>6. Negativity.</strong></h2><p>Sometimes when you’re feeling negative and down, your mood can leak out and affect other people, even if you don’t intend it to. You were hired to make your boss’s and your team’s jobs easier, not harder. People who spread negativity through their department and complain about the work or other people complicate things for everyone else. If people always have to tiptoe around you so as not to dislodge that massive chip on your shoulder, they are unlikely to be willing to do it for very long.</p><p></p><h2><strong>7. Low <a href=\"http://www.talentsmart.com/about/emotional-intelligence.php\" target=\"_blank\">emotional intelligence</a> (EQ).</strong></h2><p>Everyone knows that you can get fired for being unable or unwilling to play nicely with others, but what trips up a lot of people is having a poorly developed poker face. If everyone can tell when you’re bored or irritated or that you think something a colleague says is stupid, this will catch up with you. Emotional outbursts, belittling others, shutting co-workers down when they speak, low self-awareness, and just generally being difficult are other ways that a lack of emotional intelligence will do great harm to your career.</p><h2><strong>8. Sucking up to your boss.</strong></h2><p>Some people suck up to their boss and call it managing up, but that isn’t the case at all. Sucking up has nothing to do with a real relationship built on respect; it is sneaky and underhanded. Suck-ups try to get ahead by stroking the boss’s ego instead of earning his or her favor. That doesn’t go over well with colleagues who are trying to make it on merit. Yes, you want to bolster your relationship with your boss, but not by undermining your colleagues. That’s the key distinction here. For a boss-employee relationship to work, it has to be based on authenticity. There’s no substitute for merit.</p><h2><strong>9. Playing politics.</strong></h2><p>Working hard to build strong work relationships is very different from instigating conflict, choosing sides, undermining colleagues, spreading rumors, and all of the other things that fall under the umbrella of “playing politics.” Again, it comes down to authenticity. If you find yourself sneaking around or if you’re embarrassed if some of your behind-the-scenes manipulations come to light, that’s politics. Stick to strategies you’d be proud to discuss in front of your colleagues.</p><h3>Bringing It All Together</h3><p>A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that they can only damage their careers by making one huge misstep, but the reality is that it’s usually not that dramatic.</p>",

        "content": "<p>JUNE 13, 2016 – Shivon Zilis – HBR</p><p>When I started my career I was astounded by how superhuman some Fortune 500 executives were. It seemed they were magicians. Every time they answered an impromptu question, the response was refined. Every email they sent was worded perfectly, every decision they made based on deep market knowledge and up-to-date information. How did they do it?</p><p>Sure, they’re <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/11/are-successful-ceos-just-lucky\">smart people</a>, but they also have a secret weapon: their support staff. They have marketing teams that can pull research together in hours. They have chiefs of staff who give them carefully crafted agendas for every day, along with dossiers on everyone they are going to meet. They have sales and operations executives who ensure they have up-to-the-minute overviews of every relevant aspect of their company’s operations. These teams give Fortune 500 executives what appears to be super-human knowledge.</p><p>Fortunately for those of us who don’t have Fortune 500 budgets at our disposal, it’s getting easier and easier to build your own secret support staff. Within five years, most executives at any size company — and, indeed, most knowledge workers — will have tools that do much of the work of a CEO’s private coterie.</p><p>The reason? Machine intelligence.</p><p>“Cyborg systems,” or what I called “agents” in my <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2015/11/26/machine-intelligence-in-the-real-world/\">survey of machine intelligence startups</a>, will make this possible, using a blend of learning algorithms and distributed labor to perform an ever-widening range of tasks at low cost. With help from these agents, we’ll be able to look as smart as those CEOs do today.</p><p>We’ll also become more productive. Most knowledge workers spend less than half of their time doing things they’re really good at (i.e., what they’ve been hired to do). The rest is spent doing research, arranging meetings, coordinating with other people, and performing other minutia of office life.</p><p>These tasks could be done just as well by a machine intelligence service. For example, a typical knowledge worker might use:</p><ul><li>Scheduling and calendar coordination through agents like <a href=\"https://claralabs.com/\">Clara</a> and <a href=\"https://x.ai/\">x.ai</a></li><li>Keeping on schedule through proactive alerts like those delivered by Google Now, Siri, and Cortana</li><li>Organizing tools for regular meetings, mimicking a “Chief of staff” with a Slackbot that provides status information and facilitates meetings, like <a href=\"http://howdy.ai/\">Howdy</a>*, <a href=\"http://www.sofetch.io/products/standup-bot-open-source/\">Standup Bot</a>, <a href=\"https://tatsu.io/\">Tatsu</a>, and <a href=\"https://geekbot.io/\">Geekbot</a></li><li>Following up after meetings, with minutes complete with highlighted keywords, offered by tools like <a href=\"https://www.gridspace.com/\">Gridspace Sift</a>* and <a href=\"https://pogo.ai/\">Pogo</a>*</li><li>Indexing for written notes with handwriting recognition, like in Google Docs or Evernote</li><li>Improving writing with text-analyzing tools like <a href=\"https://textio.com/\">Textio</a>* or IBM’s Watson Tone Analyzer.</li></ul><p>(Asterisks indicate portfolio companies of Bloomberg Beta, where I am a partner.)</p><p>In cases where machine intelligence can’t yet suffice on its own, on-demand service providers like Uber, Lyft, Grubhub, and Blue Apron will give people the ability to order time-saving perks like private drivers and delivered lunches at a relatively low cost.</p><p>I got one taste of this when I started using <a href=\"http://www.askwonder.com/\">Wonder</a>*. Wonder is like having a personal researcher. They deploy a small army of experts, including trained librarians, to do small, defined research projects for me. If I want a dossier on someone I’m meeting later in the week, the lowdown on a company’s product, or a sketch of the competitive landscape for a company, I ask Wonder. For $30 to $60, Wonder saves me hours every week.</p><p>More and more products and services will fuse machine intelligence with crowd work to help users get things done. Uber is a good example: it combines on-demand drivers with algorithmic scheduling and coordination to deliver rides.</p><p>To be clear, CEO support teams aren’t going away. Top executives will continue to see benefits from dedicated, trusted support staff who can handle difficult, urgent, delicate work. But machine intelligence systems can take on elements of what these people do at a much lower cost, democratizing many of these capabilities.</p><p>Granted, there is going to be a lot of garbage before we realize the full promise of these virtual support armies. Just look at the profusion of chatbots coming on the market today. Some work very well for simple tasks. But many of them fail to live up to even basic promises, like this <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/facebook-messenger-chatbots-are-more-frustrating-than-h-1770732045\">weather bot that has trouble telling you about the weather.</a></p><p>Not every machine intelligence application will work; others will prove to be merely novelties. But if you can filter through the many new offerings to find valuable tools, your work will improve and you may even start to look like those CEOs with the seemingly superhuman abilities that I admired when I was starting out.</p>",

        "content": "<p></p><p><em>Grant Thornton Executive is led by a group of executives that have gained a solid operational experience and expertise with multiple businesses and sectors: The circle of Senior Advisors. They accompany the leaders of on all the complex issues encountered by companies for which specific expertise is required: transformation, strategic reorientation.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>How was Grant Thornton executive born?</strong></p><p>In 2006, Grant Thornton acquired an independent firm, which was essentially proposing financial services. For my part, I was recruited in 2007 to join this structure, to integrate it into Grant Thornton’s consulting deals and to evolve its business model. From 2007 to 2013 we were only performing finance missions, then we decided to expand and we accompanied officers in senior management.</p><p>Between 2013 and 2014, we have recruited freelance executives, CEO or ex-CEO, which now constitute the circle of senior advisors. They are now nearly 80 and they are all operational managers who had never done consulting before. They are freelancers, and they open their address books to bring business.</p><p>We also have about thirty senior consultants available.</p><p></p><p><strong>And what does Grant Thornton Executive do now?</strong></p><p>We have several different offers:</p><p>&#8211; A diagnosis in organization and structuring, related to digital processing for companies.</p><p>-A 48h flash diagnosis to enable start-ups to achieve strong growth.</p><p>-A Diagnostic check up transmission, in 24 hours, to raise the leader to the transmission.</p><p>We also have operational support offers in part-time or full time. A third of missions concern the general direction, a third concerns financial directions, a third concerns more diverse missions such communication or events.</p><p>What motivates the customer to choose these deals is that we put at his service at least two profiles: an operational leader and a consultant. The message is transmitted better from leader to leader.</p><p></p><p><strong>Unlike most consulting firms, they are not professional consultants, does this mean that anyone can do consulting?</strong></p><p>They are not professional consultants, but you still have to take them to an external posture. If left in a leadership position, the diagnosis is very negative or brittle. The consultant has an operational vision, but in the way of telling things and accompanying, he has more diplomacy and gentleness. The goal is to bring these executives to this posture of consulting</p><p>For start-ups, for example, we know that everything is not stringent, one must have a smooth. Some of these executives are not made for consulting. But the strength of the system is that the executives are never alone. They are always accompanied by a professional consultant.</p><p>In reality, we created an internal management committee. We do not sell a person who does everything, a superman. We sell the strength of a collective.</p><p></p><p><strong>If you prefer the experience of operational managers, so you use mostly people over 45 years?</strong></p><p>I work all generations, from 40 years to 70. I also work unemployed people, and especially I put them in relation with employed people. To link employed and unemployed people, it also brings career repositioning.</p><p></p><p><strong>How do you recruit your executives?</strong></p><p>Initially, the circle was born with my former bosses, 13 leaders who saw a potential interest in what I was trying to build. So there is a relationship and a very strong identity. If a person is not suitable, it will be rejected by the group because the others will not want to work with him.</p><p>To be recruited, a new member is co-opted, he then passes interviews, then he must be approved by a selection committee. As it is a network that works well, people come to us most often.</p><p>Actually, I first associated skills, a network, before creating the offer. If I had created the offer before and been searching people then, the collaborative dynamic would not have worked.</p><p>In fact it is the personal initiatives that bring business. Each person brings his experience and contacts, and provides a potential turnover to the group.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is it therefore a collaborative platform with a horizontal management?</strong></p><p>Exactly, to drive a collaborative platform, it is important not to put middle-managers. As they are executives of more than 50 years, they want to keep their freedom, they would leave if they were too framed. The feeling of belonging to a community is also very important, it must be maintained with events to unite the group.</p><p>But as this is consulting, there still are certain obligations to hold, reporting for example.</p><p></p><p><strong>Why are these executives freelance?</strong></p><p>This is a question of market. Usually consulting companies have few senior associates to raise margin rates. There we only have senior associates. It is therefore not possible to hire them.</p><p>For the employment of seniors from 40 to 70 years, it is a market where we can no longer provide a full-time employment. So if they are freelancers, either they work with temporary work agencies or with consulting firms. In Grant Thornton Executive, they are freelancers who are integrated into a collective. They lose 45% of the sale price, but they have a steady workflow and a network.</p><p>Grant Thornton Executive’s strength is its strong brand identity. Allowing it to withstand the digital platforms.</p>",

        "content": "<p>JUNE 23rd, 2016</p><p><em>We met Yann Varin, 30 years, who both worked in consulting and founded a start-up. His pathway proves there are bridges between these fields.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>What is your career pathway ?</strong></p><p>I first studied theoretical physics at the ENS Cachan (ed. : a prestigious public institution of higher education and research founded in 1913,<span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\"> </span>one of the major French Grandes Écoles, which are considered the pinnacle of French higher education.), but I did not want to become a researcher or a teacher. Then I began to work in strategic consulting at Mars &amp; Co. It is a very challenging job, that enables the development of analytical skills.</p><p>Then I wanted to do entrepreneurship, so I launched a digital start-up with a partner. It was a media and a social network on running, a mass sport. It also interested me much to work on digital issues. We quickly grew an important traffic on our network, but, on the Internet, once you made a quality traffic, the challenge is to find a way to monetize it. We finally didn’t find the business model of our start-up, so we sold it.</p><p></p><p><strong>Did strategy consulting make you want to start entrepreneurship?</strong></p><p>No, to do entrepreneurship, you must first have the desire to do it. But the skills developed in strategy consulting are very effective in many areas, such as customer approach. Being an entrepreneur is different, it’s less framed, you have to do all jobs… The analytical skills you develop in strategic consulting are formative, but then the ability to do entrepreneurship corresponds more to certain types of profiles and personalities.</p><p>But you can also go back from a start-up to strategy consulting. It gives a double expertise, combining strategy consulting skills after your studies and a field experience in a start-up to better understand customer issues.</p><p>So it is quite possible to go from theoretical physics to strategy consulting, then go in a start-up, and finally return to strategy consulting. That&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m doing.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you think your experience of entrepreneurship will serve you in consulting? Are you going to work as a consultant differently?</strong></p><p>Yes, having been at the heart of a start-up, sometimes in difficulties, will be useful to better understand customers’ problems. In addition, the experience of start-up is increasingly valued in consulting, French Tech is fashionable. Many consultants would like to spend time in a start-up, and then return to consulting with this new expertise. Conversely, many start-ups recruit consultants for their analytical capabilities.</p><p></p><p><strong>Therefore gateways between different fields are more important?</strong></p><p>Yes, and they are becoming more accessible, it is very complementary and more valued by recruitment firms and consulting. Experience in a start-up, for example, is more valued than an experience in an internal strategy department, because it is partitioned and limited to an industry and a profession. Working in a start-up can help develop a resourcefulness and get out of complicated situations more easily.</p><p></p><p><strong>How do you think consulting will be in the future? Do you think this business will evolve?</strong></p><p>Consulting is changing ; historically, it was a traditional and hierarchical business. But the big players reach critical size, for example McKinsey recruits experts, such as UX designers and data scientists. They like to have more in-house experts, so they are diversifying the profiles.</p><p>On one side consultancies therefore modernized. But on the other side there are also more and more people who want to enhance their expertise, but retaining flexibility. So there is also a community of freelancers which is growing, they are older people, seniors who want to enhance their great experience, but also young people who want more freedom.</p><p></p><p><strong>What do you think of this platformization movement? Can it reach consulting?</strong></p><p>Like any platform, it requires a match between supply and demand, so there is no difficulty for the supply in my opinion. On the freelance side there is a desire, it grows. But on the client side there is still a critical size to achieve to make it work. This market must be educated, so that customers have confidence.</p><p></p><p><strong>One more thing to add?</strong></p><p>I have an unusual career, with a theoretical scientific training, and it allowed me to work in several areas. It is good that France is beginning to break down barriers and to develop more diverse skills. It is already the case in USA. I have a career that shows it is possible to enhance the diversity of profiles within an organization.</p>",

Isn&rsquo;t it time we rethought the way we view time and career? Aren&rsquo;t our work lives a series of waves we should learn to surf?</p><p>The institutions we inherited from the mass economy era &mdash; when linear careers were the norm &mdash; are still dominant: our education system caters to the young and our pension systems cater to the old. Our expectations are still shaped by this era, its institutions and the culture it produced: we expect to graduate before 25, start a career in a profession, grow and excel at it, climb a ladder &mdash; whatever that ladder may be &mdash; , reach its summit and retire, to finally reap the hard-earned rewards of a successful work life. Each age matches a given stage. An age/ stage discrepancy &mdash; not graduating before 25, not achieving professional recognition at 35, not retiring at 65 &mdash; results in shame or frustration.</p><p>But today increasingly few individuals have their work lives mapped out for them in a linear way. It seems the linear model is turned upside down. Young people are students forever and never actually get started for good in their careers. Older people never retire, either because they can&rsquo;t afford to &mdash; pension systems aren&rsquo;t what they used to be &mdash; , or because they don&rsquo;t want to. People start new careers in mid-life either because there is no viable future for them in their old careers or because they&rsquo;re bored in them. It&rsquo;s as if no age had its given stage any more.</p><h4><strong>Work lives are made of waves</strong></h4><p>Inthe 1920s, Soviet economist Nikolai <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FKondratiev_wave\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FKondratiev_wave\">Kondratiev</a> was one of the first economists who described the &ldquo;<em>long waves</em>&rdquo; &mdash; long economic cycles &mdash; in our modern world economy. His book, <em>The Major Economic Cycles</em> (1925), was groundbreaking. A decade or so later, another economist, Joseph Schumpeter, suggested naming these long economic cycles &ldquo;Kondratiev cycles&rdquo; in his honor.</p><p><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile2.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile2.png 520w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile2-300x138.png 300w\" alt=\"fertile2\" width=\"520\" height=\"239\" /></p><p>The period of a wave ranges from 40 to 60 years with alternating intervals between sectoral growth and intervals of relatively slow growth. According to the innovation theory, these waves arise from technological revolutions that create new leading industrial or commercial sectors. Schumpeter studied the relationship between technological innovation and economic cycles. More recently, Carlota Perez perfected the study of <em>S curves</em> &mdash; the beginning of a technological era is the <em>irruption</em>, the ascent is the <em>frenzy</em>, the rapid build the <em>synergy</em> and the completion is the <em>maturity</em>.</p><p>It seems our individual work lives are increasingly made of similar &mdash; albeit shorter &mdash; waves: irruption, frenzy, synergy, maturity followed by irruption, frenzy, synergy, maturity <em>etc</em>. Because innovation transforms and disrupts the professions increasingly fast, because corporations have become mortal and no longer support life-long careers, there are now often several different waves in our individual work lives. One could very well apply the concepts of the &ldquo;<em>long economic cycles</em>&rdquo; to individual career cycles. There are &ldquo;long career cycles&rdquo;.</p><p><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile3.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile3.png 800w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile3-300x225.png 300w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile3-768x576.png 768w\" alt=\"fertile3\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" /></p><section><div><div><p>In <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStart-up-You-Future-Yourself-Transform-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0050DIWHU\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStart-up-You-Future-Yourself-Transform-ebook%2Fdp%2FB0050DIWHU\"><em>The Start-up of You</em></a>, Ben Casnocha and Reid Hoffman <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffr.slideshare.net%2Freidhoffman%2Fstartup-of-you-visual-summary%2F4-All_human_beingsare_entrepreneursWhen_we\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffr.slideshare.net%2Freidhoffman%2Fstartup-of-you-visual-summary%2F4-All_human_beingsare_entrepreneursWhen_we\">argue convincingly</a>that each individual career will increasingly have to be handled like a personal venture, a start-up that must find its model, sometimes pivot, go through ups and downs, and reinvent itself several times. The notion that there are cycles in our careers is becoming ever more commonplace. Many self-help books offer to teach us to &ldquo;surf these waves&rdquo; and make the best of it.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><h4><strong>In-between waves lies fertility</strong></h4><p>It&rsquo;s not so much the &ldquo;ups&rdquo; that we find hard to accept as the &ldquo;downs&rdquo; that we struggle to cope with. Waves include periods of ascent, climaxes, periods of descent and depressing nadirs (low points) during which nothing positive seems to be happening. The second phase of a wave &mdash; descent and nadir &mdash; , seem to imply destruction and depression. On a personal level, those are fairly hard to accept.</p><p>But, according to author Charles Handy, these periods are a lot more positive than they seem, because they serve as preparation for the next phase &mdash; ascent and climax. He argues that we should jump to the &ldquo;<em>second curve</em>&rdquo; of our careers, however challenging that may seem, before the first one turns downward. Handy, now 83, began his own &ldquo;second curve&rdquo; before he turned 50, when he became a freelance management &ldquo;guru&rdquo;. <a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2F2d431aba-c0c8-11e4-9949-00144feab7de\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcontent%2F2d431aba-c0c8-11e4-9949-00144feab7de\"><em>The Second Curve</em></a> is his best-selling book.</p><p><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile4.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile4.jpeg 638w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile4-300x225.jpeg 300w\" alt=\"fertile4\" width=\"638\" height=\"479\" /></p></div></div></section><p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.envisioning.nl%2Fpubl_elf-paradox.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.envisioning.nl%2Fpubl_elf-paradox.pdf\"><em>Luckily</em></a><em>, there is life beyond the curve. The secret of constant growth is to start a new Sigmoid Curve before the first one peters out. The right place to start that second curve is at point A, where there is the time, as well as the resources and the energy, to get the new curve through its initial explorations and floundering before the first curve begins to dip downwards</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>In-between waves is when the next phase is actively prepared. In concrete terms, it means that we must learn to understand that ascent and climax won&rsquo;t last forever and think about the next stage before things turn bad. It means that we must undertake to learn a new craft, look for a new job or start a new venture precisely when things appear to be fine. Launching the next phase before the cycle is finished is what will make it possible to launch a new phase of ascent before we can be badly hurt by the descent and nadir of the previous one.</p><p><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile5.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile5.png 800w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile5-300x216.png 300w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile5-768x552.png 768w\" alt=\"fertile5\" width=\"800\" height=\"575\" /></p><section><div><div><p>There&rsquo;s something truly liberating about letting go of our linear expectations. Accepting that there are several waves in our work lives, that there is no one stage for one age, and that there will be periods of descent, can be a load off any individual&rsquo;s mind. Because our expectations, our culture and our institutions have survived the destruction of the old linear paradigm, we have to proactively change these expectations, culture and institutions&hellip;</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><h4><strong>Linearity should no longer be at the core of our institutions</strong></h4><p>There is a growing mismatch between our institutions and the timing of our work lives. Fewer people are covered by the social insurance institutions created for the post-war boom years. Our education systems aren&rsquo;t meant for continuous learning. Our pension systems are increasingly failing. Unemployment insurance is meant for <em>insiders</em> only. Non-salaried freelance workers are in the process of inventing their own institutions, but by and large they&rsquo;re still not seen as a new norm by government, public services and society at large. That makes it harder for them to get access to decent housing for example.</p><p><a href=\"https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCharles_Handy\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCharles_Handy\">Charles Handy</a> extends the idea of the &ldquo;<em>second curve</em>&rdquo; from individual careers to society at large, government and institutions, which he believes must be reinvented. The institutions which used to protect us (schools, universities, companies, friendships, marriages and pensions) are all under threat, he writes. The old authorities have lost their credibility and their power.</p><p>These new institutions should cater to everyone regardless of age and stage. If we are to prepare for the next curve at different moments of our lives, we are to be helped by the institutions and systems we contribute to, which should take the cyclical aspect of our work lives into account. Examples of these new institutions that could be debated today include:</p><ul><li>The creation of a universal basic income (currently tested out in Finland);</li><li>Longer subsidized parental leaves (not necessarily immediately after birth, but throughout childhood) that would ease the pain of the &ldquo;generation exhausted&rdquo; whose &ldquo;climaxes&rdquo; both in family lives and work lives make them constantly exhausted and unable to prepare for the next curve;</li><li>Social insurance schemes to cover new risks (like housing);</li><li>Education systems that target people from all class ages.</li></ul><p>Clearly &ldquo;<em>From the cradle to the grave</em>&rdquo; can be understood in a non-linear way to include different life cycles!</p><p>Institutions also include companies and corporations that still largely function with the old paradigm and aren&rsquo;t ready to recruit and manage the ever higher number of workers who have already left the linear paradigm. New ways for companies to recruit and manage in the non-linear age will have to be invented. So that the value of multi-career workers can be recognized and made use of&hellip;</p><p><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile.jpeg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile.jpeg 760w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/fertile-300x200.jpeg 300w\" alt=\"fertile\" width=\"760\" height=\"507\" /></p></div></div></section>",

You can’t just rely on your current knowledge and expertise if you expect to keep up, let alone advance. But how do you identify the areas in which development efforts will yield the best return on your investment?</div><div><div><p>In our years coaching executives, my colleagues and I have noticed that people who improve in ways that best support their success look for the overlap between what their organization needs and what will give them the most satisfaction. We’ve discovered that using a version of Jim Collins’s <a href=\"http://www.jimcollins.com/media_topics/hedgehog-concept.html#audio=79\" target=\"_blank\">“hedgehog” idea</a>, from <em>Good to Great</em>, helps clients think it through. Collins found that great organizations focus on three things: what will drive their economic engine, what they can be best in the world at, and what they are most passionate about. The approach, he has noted, is just as good for figuring out how to become “great” individually. Here’s how it works:</p><p><strong>Driving the economic engine:</strong> We encourage executives to focus on this element first. How can you grow in a way that will help the organization succeed? For example, if you’re in operations, you might identify several business-critical areas for improvement. By learning to better manage large custom client projects, you could significantly reduce cycle and delivery times. By becoming more knowledgeable about sourcing materials, you could reduce expenses. And by improving your communication skills and setting clearer direction for your employees, you could boost productivity. All three could positively impact the bottom line.</p><div></div><p><strong>Best at</strong>: Once you’ve surfaced useful capabilities you might develop, think about whether you could become really excellent at them. One way to do that is to consider whether you’re good at doing similar things. For instance, if you’re already quite organized and sequential when you approach your tasks, that bodes well for being able to learn complex project management. And if you’re already clear in your own mind about what needs to be done and who’s best to do it, you could probably learn to more effectively share that thinking with your team. On the other hand, if you’re just OK at research, getting really good at sourcing materials might be difficult.</p><p><strong>Passionate about</strong>: As soon as you’ve gotten a sense of where your potential strengths match up with useful areas for development, honestly assess how interested you are in those areas. Let’s say, for example, that of the two skills you believe you could get quite good at — project management and providing clearer direction — you’re much more interested in and excited about the former. As an ops person, the idea of taking a formal course on process architecture really appeals to you; working on your “soft skills” does not. So go ahead and sign up for the process seminar. But also recognize that you have more control over this element of the “hedgehog” model than any other. You can, in fact, <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fproteusleader.com%2Fresources%2Fvideo%2Fbe-bad-first-an-overview\" target=\"_blank\">increase your desire to learn</a> particular skills simply by identifying the personal benefits of doing so and then envisioning a future in which you’re reaping those benefits. For example, getting better at talking to employees about goals and timelines and giving them balanced feedback might create a more positive team culture and demonstrate that you’re worthy of being promoted to a more senior management role. Picture your team proud and happy and your boss congratulating you on those accomplishments. Chances are you’ll now be more interested in working to improve those skills.</p><p>Given all the ways in which organizations and jobs are changing, figuring out which new skills to develop and when to develop them can be hard. The key is to focus on skills that will propel your organization forward, that play to your strengths, and that you feel passionate about learning.</p></div><div></div></div><p></p>",

        "content": "<p>JANUARY 20, 2016 — Andy Molinsky and Sujin Jang — HBR</p><div><div><div><p>The first thing most of us do when working with people from a new culture is to learn about differences. And there are very sensible reasons to do so. It helps you avoid cultural faux pas. For example, if your Korean employee will likely be embarrassed if you praise him in public, it would be good to know that ahead of time so you can anticipate his reaction and alter your own behavior plan. Similarly, if you know that an American employer expects you to look her in the eye, give a firm handshake, and speak positively about yourself, it’s important for you to know that as well, even if those very same behaviors would be considered inappropriate where you come from. Focusing on cultural differences also helps you learn to correctly interpret and make sense of the behavior of others.</p><p>But focusing on differences alone can have its downsides. For one thing, there’s a decent chance you’ll be wrong. The Italian employee you anticipate being late for meetings turns out to be the most punctual person on your team, and the Asian consultant you just hired and anticipated having to mentor about participating in meetings actually ends up being the most outgoing and assertive person in the room.</p><p>Focusing on differences can also be quite mentally taxing. Think about it: You walk into a room and your mind races with all the different cultural differences you need to remember — that you’re not supposed to do X, Y, or Z and that your partners from another culture may be doing A, B, or C, and each of these behaviors has a specific meaning in that culture that’s different from yours. It’s enough to make your head spin!</p><p>So, if you don’t focus on differences, what then can you do to be more effective across cultures? In our experience, an equally plausible and highly effective alternative technique is to focus on similarities — on what you have in common, instead of what you don’t. And this subtle twist in perspective can have some pretty powerful effects.</p><p>If you think about it, this is probably exactly how you establish connections and relationships in your own culture. You don’t approach a person thinking about all the potential ways you could be different; instead, you naturally gravitate to similarities, to finding things you might have in common to <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2015%2F09%2Fhow-to-build-the-social-ties-you-need-at-work\" target=\"_blank\">form the basis of a relationship</a>. Although we tend to approach cross-cultural interactions quite differently, the same technique actually works just as well across cultures. When focused on similarities, you’re open to — and, in fact, looking for — a potential connection. Perhaps it’s a hobby you share in common with a coworker, or maybe both of you at a business meeting abroad have families you’re trying to connect with through Skype. Maybe you’re both fans of football (European or American). You can discover these similarities in conversation, or even by picking up on things you notice — like pictures on a person’s desk, a coffee cup from a particular store you also like, or a passing remark someone makes about something you share in common. The possibilities are endless, but by focusing on similarities you have the power to create connections and build relationships that either supersede cultural differences or make them irrelevant.</p><p>Another advantage of this approach is that your counterpart is more likely to feel that you see them as an individual, not just as a cultural stereotype. As we said earlier, focusing on differences can lead you to overgeneralize or assume certain things about someone from another culture, <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2016%2F01%2Fcultural-differences-are-more-complicated-than-what-country-youre-from\" target=\"_blank\">which may or may not be true for the particular person</a> you’re interacting with. On the other hand, focusing on similarities means you are attuned to the particularities of the specific person you are interacting with. This is more likely to result in the other party feeling seen and heard for who they are, and can kick off a positive spiral of mutual openness and trust.</p><p>“But what if I embarrass myself or offend someone?” you may ask. After all, a major benefit of focusing on differences is that it can enable you to <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2013%2F03%2Fpreparing-for-inevitable-cultural\" target=\"_blank\">avoid cultural mistakes</a>, and by shifting your focus to similarities, you may risk doing or saying something inappropriate. Making the connection with another individual may go against the grain of your personality — or your cultural background — and you may stumble along the way. Or you may find yourself as the cultural minority or with relatively little status or power, which can make it more challenging to take up this approach.</p><p>Although making mistakes is a valid concern, the good news is that your counterpart’s reaction to your cultural faux pas is likely to be much more forgiving when you have already built a rapport. By forging a connection based on similarities, you create an interpersonal environment that is psychologically safer for you and the other party. This means that even if you make a mistake, it is not immediately held against you, and you are more likely to be able to laugh it off, or even use it as an opportunity to learn more about one another’s culture. And if you can develop the courage and willingness to get past such barriers, you’ll be surprised at how effective it can be to look past the obvious differences and focus instead on the things we share.</p></div></div><div></div></div><p></p>",

And <a href=\"http://www.blissyoupro.com\">Bliss You Pro</a> offers tailors-made programs to companies in order to  increase the well-being and performances of employees with mind-body practices and alternative medicine.</em></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>What is the history of Bliss You?</strong></p><p>Bliss You was created 8 months ago. This is primarily a platform which put in relation practitioners in alternative medicine and individuals. Alternative medicine includes several practices such as relaxation therapy, yoga, meditation, self-hypnosis&#8230; The common point of all these practices is that they appeal to the natural capacity for self-healing we all have. So we have a BtoC space, where each practitioner proposes what he wants, I assure a selection for these practitioners, and a BtoB part, more focused, where I organize special sessions for companies .</p><p>Before creating Bliss You, I worked 6 years in marketing innovation. It was a challenging environment with a lot of stress to deal with. Today, stress becomes somewhat rewarding, a performance marker. But this is not a good model of life in the long run, it undermines the motivation and performance.</p><p></p><p><strong>Today, we often define ourselves by work. Do you think that we should redefine our relationship to work?</strong></p><p>I think we should see work as a space of Life. The professional and personal spheres influence each other a lot, so the company must become prescriptive of life changes, it should take the place of large institutions to ensure the welfare of its employees. The company must demonstrate a good will into employees&#8217; privacy. This is their new role.</p><p></p><p><strong>How can these practices improve corporate performance?</strong></p><p>It creates a security bubble, a relationship with oneself which deals with your corporeality. This is to disconnect from the daily workflow to reconnect with yourself. It allows to develop real breaks in the rhythm of work. This distanceyou take allows to boost your creativity and your ability to solve problems.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is self hypnosis?</strong></p><p>It is therapeutic hypnosis, often used in hospitals, the goal is to use the subconscious to set goals, such as having more confidence, better sleep&#8230; This is pretty pragmatic. In business there are many fears, such as not being up to something, quarrel with collegues&#8230; The goal is to use the subconscious to disable these fears and soothe the employee.</p><p></p><p><strong>You offer coaching to non-violent communication, what is it?</strong></p><p>It is a tool to teach employees to step back and think before reacting. We often react over a short time, but we must learn to think before speaking. If you get a violent mail, wait a moment, do not answer to violence with violence. There are language tricks to allow employees to continue working in benevolence. We must cultivate it to create more trust and collaboration in companies, and less frustration.</p><p></p><p><strong>Does it imply to do extensive work on the collective?</strong></p><p>It also requires the manager to do this work, it takes a lot of time and energy. Often they do not have the time and energy so they do not. It also demands a lot of will to get out of complicated situations.</p><p>There is also a need for the manager to reinvent his role. He becomes someone who will create link in the company, between employees, rather than just giving orders.</p><p></p><p><strong>Is there a change in mentality? What is the profile of the most receptive companies?</strong></p><p>This is changing in profound ways. HR are transforming themselves and alternative medicine are welcome. But there is no typical profile for companies, it depends on the HRD and his personality. Today there are many large groups for whom it is important to bet on human capital.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you have an advice for stressed consultants ?</strong></p><p>Listen to your body, know your limits and do not go exceed them.</p>",

I worked in consulting before, and I took some benefits from that experience because I am both a consultant, a coach and a facilitator. Just like in consulting, I bring answers. I coach leaders and high potentials on specific topics, like development of collective potential.</p><p>But I am not alone, I work with an european network, with people in Germany and UK.</p><p></p><p><strong>Are there differences in the way you have to coach in different countries with different cultures ?</strong></p><p>There are specificities related to cultures. But also in the way coaching is perceived. In UK people solicit you, they are proud to have a coach.</p><p>In French companies, getting a coach might mean you have a problem. Excellence and perfection are French values. Admitting you are not perfect is sometimes an issue for some people.</p><p>Maybe we should communicate more on coaching, but I prefer people to come to me naturally. It often happens at the end of a lecture for example.</p><p></p><p><strong>How to make somebody more performant ? Is it sometimes necessary to unplug from work to enhance your performance ? To change your relationship to work ?</strong></p><p>Coaching is not teaching. Coaching is a way of stepping back and looking from a different perspective. I help people to think about the changes they want to bring. I often see people who have time issues, they are running against time. It is often a pay off on their private life and they are emotionally worn.</p><p>The life-work balance is always present in all coaching. The goal is to help these leaders, and make them realize they have to lead themselves to lead other. Learn how to say no, not to send e-mails in the week-end, to incite your members to take care of their own balance. I send a lot of clients to massages. Meditation also helps them to step back from the rush and the pressure.</p><p>The positive stress is the one who brings adrenaline. But there is also a negative stress, when everything is out of control. You are controlled by the operational pressure.</p><p>A leader needs to drive teams in a positive area of trusting.</p><p></p><p><strong>You also do team-building, what is your opinion on lean management ?</strong></p><p>I think lean management is structuring in a way that stimulates more teamwork. A leadership that is focused on the needs of the teams, away from the hierarchical model, that is obsolete.</p><p>There is a real tension between the classic structure and the inspiration for an more simple way to work.</p><p>For example, I met a man who was hired to bring modernity to an organisation, he came from an anglo-saxon company, with a different approach. But he had to adapt to the culture of the company. So he got confusing messages. Because he was hired to change things and he was reproached at the same time to do his job, not to fit with the culture.</p><p>The cultural gap is huge, and people resist to change. There is a sclerosis routine that needs to be shaken up.</p><p>But these new kinds of organisations cannot be imposed from the outside. An organisation needs to be ready for change. People will resist the change, it can be counter-productive.</p><p>There is a sentence in coaching : « learning to unlearn in order to relearn ».</p><p>I would say that an organisation needs to unlearn, visit its status quo, its history, beliefs, to be ready to embrace news beliefs.</p><p></p><p><strong>What are your different tools to trigger this dynamic ?</strong></p><p>You have to bring awareness, so that people realize there is a contradiction. They want the change but they do nothing for it. Alignement coaching is important, to think together about what is our common purpose, how do we get this change. The first thing to do is shaking off the practices and the beliefs.</p><p>The coach doesn’t bring the answers, he asks the questions. A coach doesn’t tell solutions. The professional coach just brings awareness, brings alignement on what is functioning. What do we have to preserve, what do we have to shake off.</p><p>As a coach, framing is essential. Working with creativity is possible when you have a clear framework of the process. You need to know who is the sponsor of the coaching. And to be sure that the three parties are aligned on the same objectives. The coach must not be involved in the system, in the hierarchy. When you start to work with the team, you regard the team leader as one member of the system, he is no longer the sponsor. It is very important to have ethics.</p><p></p><p><strong>Today there are more and more non-permanent workers in organizations. How can you do team building in this context ?</strong></p><p>These are trends that are very common. We work as independent people, but we create ad hoc team for specific projects. There is a team building around that project. We still need, in this nomadic way of working, to build more short term but still focused team building approaches.</p><p>There is more focus needed on developing and getting a sense of belonging. You cannot just patchwork people. It’s even more important to invest in the team.</p><p>In a context of task oriented culture, we can go there easily. But for Latin culture we need link more, to meet.</p><p>For example, in a franco-dutch company, we did teambuilding. It was difficult to build common practices, because Dutch people are very task oriented. French have to connect, So, French people were irritated when Dutch people moved to fast on the task. And Dutch where irritated when French lose time on connecting. So they took a specific time for a virtual coffee, they planned it and implemented it is the agenda.</p><p>We need to invent news ways of connecting. And to adapt digital to our needs.</p><p></p><p><strong>A last advice for consultants ?</strong></p><p>You need to enhance your personal leadership, to be strategic about how you set boundaries between things that are priorities and things that are not priorities. Knowing how to say no is also crucial.</p><p>Be the leader of your own activity is very important.</p>",

        "content": "<p><strong><em>Written by Adrien Cools</em></strong></p><p>SEPTEMBER 27, 2016</p><p>Are you overloaded by work emails? Then you are not alone. Research conducted by HR magazine and IBM entitled &lsquo;The Reclaim Your Time&rsquo; survey found that 34% of HR professionals checked their email every day on waking up and 38 percent checked emails every night at home. Half of the respondents stated their productivity increased with more face-to-face communication and 46% said that while email is useful it takes time away from more valuable tasks.</p><p>Useless emails and being copied onto emails are one of the main distractions of the 21st Century workplace, remarked Professor Cary Cooper, professor of organizational psychology and health at Manchester Business School. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the multi-media age we live in where we go to work, get a phone call and a notification on our mobile at the same time. Most distractions stem from social media and open-plan offices. There are absolutely more distractions in the workplace now with social media. Everybody has a mobile and needs to check their twitter account and they will be contacted by relatives and other people.&rdquo;</p><p>He called email overload the biggest cause of &ldquo;productivity damage&rdquo; for the UK workforce and urged HR professionals to &ldquo;get in touch&rdquo; with the issue. Cooper believes one of the reasons that the UK is low down on the G7 list of countries in terms of productivity is its very advanced use of social media. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re technologically very advanced and because we embrace it that is a problem.&rdquo; Employees who are distracted are less productive and engaged, said Cooper. &ldquo;Employee engagement is impacted as people are glued to their computer screen or mobile device and not talking to each other.&rdquo;</p><p>The software firm Sanebox conducted research to explore the relevant of emails received by employees. It found that the average person receives between 60 and 70 legitimate emails per day yet Sanebox&rsquo;s year-to-date data for 2015 shows that between 63% and 64% of these emails aren&rsquo;t important.How can employees ensure that they are not overloaded with emails? This is a particular problem if you&rsquo;ve been on vacation and the last thing you wish to see is an inbox with 500 unread emails.</p><p>During your absence, hundreds of emails have accumulated in your mailbox. To sort out your mails and reply can sometimes take considerable time. Some tips to be more effective:</p><p><strong>Before leaving on vacation:</strong></p><p>Going on vacation, let people know! Your mailbox allows you to send a general message of absence to your colleagues and contacts. An automatic response will also be sent to your contacts, indicating your holiday dates. This allows people not to get impatient waiting for a response that does not come and not to flood you of emails.</p><p>Unsubscribe newsletters or other regular mail you receive during the year and may never be read on your return. The number of received mails is so important that we should not bother with parasitic messages. This avoids unnecessary clutter. It can also be helpful to have multiple mailboxes for those wishing to compartmentalize private and professional life.</p><p><strong>During the holidays :</strong></p><p>Whether on vacation or not, some business executives or employees fail to stall. We must still pay attention to continuous connections and take moments of respite. The key is to treat your emails without necessarily answer all. This allows not to be surprised by bad news or urgent business to deal with when you return.</p><p>Others are totally disconnected. In this case, delegate to someone you trust, remained at the company, the task of managing urgent messages or warn you in case of problems.</p><p>The important thing is to CHOOSE how you wish to work.</p><p><strong>When you return to work :</strong></p><p>Mail management is a matter of organization and priority management. People who receive a lot of emails should conduct a first reading to identify important messages of others, then go back taking their time on each of them to respond, to classify them or put them on hold.</p><p>The good working practices acquired after the holidays are also valid for the rest of the year:</p><p>Devote specific time slots (maximum1H30) to view, sort and answer to your emails. Switching from task to task is indeed counterproductive. Treating important cases bit by bit is necessary. The mail management should be planned as an appointment on your agenda.&rdquo;</p><p>Delete mails is necessary when we know that the majority of emails we receive are either spam or messages that are irrelevant. A Symantec survey of spam (taken with caution since this company sells anti-spam solutions) shows that within the single month of July 2009, 89% of the emails were spam. Over 13 months, this figure reaches 90%. A first glance makes it possible to make a first quick sort.</p><p>Other advice, empty regularly your inbox, every night, or at least every Friday night to start with a clean box. This avoids keeping problems to solve later and to save time at the next consultation. An employee who does not delete any mail may one day or the other, see its inbox saturated and have to spend hours to sort messages.</p><p>Sorting your emails into folders also allows to go faster, especially to find important information. You can do it directly on your mailbox or on your computer. Some companies even have an intranet in which each employee can store his documents safely.</p><p>To answer the important mails, it is advisable to do it bit by bit and to devote yourself fully. Some emails are sometimes difficult to write and deserve to linger a little longer. To disconnect from your mailbox and write your message with a clear head is often advised. You can then avoid sharp and hasty answers.</p>",

Their experiments have shown, for instance, that people work harder when they get feedback, set ambitious goals, and are given incentivizes.</p><p>But after recently conducting <a href=\"http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/ROB%20paper.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a review</a> of more than 150 scientific articles on motivation, we found that each of these motivational tools can also unexpectedly backfire. For example, positive feedback can lead recipients to relax their effort, overly ambitious goals can cause employees to give up, and incentives can undermine intrinsic interest.</p><p>Chances are that you (at least sometimes) are using the wrong tools under the wrong circumstances. We propose a set of guidelines for when and how to use different types of motivational tactics, so that you can better understand how to effectively motivate yourself and others.</p><h3><strong>Feedback</strong></h3><p>There are two primary forms of feedback: positive and negative. Neither one is better than the other. In some circumstances, positive feedback can be more effective for motivation because it increases people’s commitment and confidence. In others, negative feedback can be more effective because it signals that more effort is needed.</p><p>Because positive feedback enhances personal commitment, it works best when recipients are questioning their commitment to a task. That’s why novices or people who are disengaged are best served by positive feedback. A new employee is likely to thrive under positive feedback, but wilt under negative feedback.</p><p>In contrast, negative feedback is ideal for people who are already committed to achieving their goals, but just need a push to reach them. Feedback that emphasizes their lack of progress increases their motivation. So people with expertise in a particular domain, such as professional speakers, not only respond better to negative feedback, they also <a href=\"http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/Advances%20Fishbach%20et%20al.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">seek more negative feedback</a>.</p><h3><strong>Goal Setting</strong></h3><p>To increase performance, it is often useful to set challenging and proximal deadlines (e.g., “finish reading a professional magazine in the <a href=\"http://www-2.rotman.utoronto.ca/facbios/file/09%20-%20Locke%20&amp;%20Latham%202002%20AP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">next 30 minutes</a>”). People—even animals—tend to work harder and faster when approaching a <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1932-01362-001\" target=\"_blank\">finish line</a>.</p><p>Typically, a shorter distance between you and your goal is more motivating than a longer one. It feels within reach, and it’s easier to feel that you’re making progress. This means people should set closer targets or sub-goals. So instead of telling yourself or your employees to finish a project in the next month, focus on achieving certain milestones by the end of each week.</p><p>Research also shows that when beginning to pursue a goal, people should focus on the progress they’ve made rather than on the progress they still have to make. Only when they’re closer to the finish line should people focus on the remaining distance between them and their goal. Focusing on the least amount of distance—either from the start or from the end of your project— is more motivating.</p><p>For example, consider loyalty programs that use “buy 10, get one free” cards. These can focus consumers on either accumulated progress (by stamping the card for each purchase) or remaining progress (by punching a hole in the card). A study showed that those who are farther from the reward are more <a href=\"http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/small%20area.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">motivated when</a> they receive stamps, because the card highlights how much progress they have already made. Conversely, those who are close to the reward are more likely to keep buying when holes are punched in the card, because that method highlights what is still between them and their reward.</p><div></div><p>People are also particularly conscientious of their work when they are just beginning to pursue a goal and when they’ve nearly reached it. <a href=\"http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ayelet.fishbach/research/TF_JEPG_2011.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Research has found</a> that people are more likely to slack off or behave unethically around the middle of a project. Since people will produce their highest quality work as they’re getting started or about to wrap up, it might be useful to re-frame their goal pursuit—by setting smaller goals, for example—so that people don’t feel stuck in the middle.</p><p>Another common mistake with goal setting is choosing the wrong means or approach for achieving your objectives. Research has shown that it’s more effective to tailor your approach based on one specific goal you’re trying to reach than to apply a one-size-fits-all approach that could work for any goal. For example, if you want to have more productive staff meetings, it may help to choose an office space that is only used for important group meetings, rather than one that people also associate with one-on-ones or lunch breaks.</p><h3><strong>Incentives</strong></h3><p>Incentives can be categorized into three types: immediate (vs. delayed), certain (vs. uncertain), and extrinsic (vs. intrinsic).</p><p>Immediate incentives are psychologically more appealing than delayed incentives. People will work harder for incentives they can get sooner—even if they are smaller than those they would get after <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11002-005-5897-x\" target=\"_blank\">waiting longer</a>. The lesson here is simple: To motivate people, use immediate incentives.</p><p>People similarly prefer incentives of a certain value over those of an uncertain value. For example, compared to a promotion that offers shoppers an uncertain reward (e.g., “$30 or $50 off if you spend over $200”), one with a certain reward (e.g., “$40 off if you spend over $200”) would more likely fare better.</p><p>However, there are times when uncertain incentives can be more motivating. If they offer a higher potential value, for instance, people may be optimistic and more motivated to pursue them. They can also be exciting, leading some to work harder. In one experiment participants evaluated a series of print advertisements in return for a prize of either a certain amount or an uncertain amount. In the certain conditions, participants expected a bonus of 50% of their base pay. In the uncertain condition, the bonus could either be 20% or 50% of their base pay (to be determined by a lottery). People who expected a bonus of 50% of their base pay worked less hard than those who weren’t sure what their bonus would ultimately be, which suggests that “mystery” rewards (i.e., of uncertain value) can be exciting and push some to work harder.</p><p>Incentives can also be extrinsic (e.g., money, perks, etc.) or intrinsic (e.g., satisfying work). Some activities offer both: a paying job can also be satisfying. However, adding extrinsic incentives often leads people to see less intrinsic benefit. In <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/677224#fndtn-references_tab_contents\" target=\"_blank\">one study</a>, children were less willing to consume food when it was framed as healthy (extrinsic benefit), because they then perceived the food as being less tasty (lower intrinsic benefit).</p><p>People also seem to value intrinsic incentives more when they are in the middle of pursuing a goal than when they have not yet started. This is why when people are selecting a job, they often put relatively less emphasis on things such as interest in the task and employee morale, compared with extrinsic benefits like salary. But when going to the job each day, people care relatively more about these <a href=\"http://home.uchicago.edu/~kwoolley/Woolley&amp;FishbachJPSP2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">intrinsic incentives</a>. Thus, tangible incentives should be emphasized in advance, while more intrinsic ones should be used to motivate employees already working toward something.</p><p>Just as people fail to recognize the value of intrinsic incentives for themselves, they also underestimate its importance for others. People tend to believe interesting work tasks and morale are more important to them <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Ffaculty-gsb.stanford.edu%2Fheath%2Fdocuments%2Fsocial%2520psych%2520of%2520agency.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">than to their colleagues</a>. As a result, when motivating others, people may choose to use fewer intrinsic incentives than they would for themselves.</p><div></div><p>All of this behavioral research can provide guidance on how to better motivate yourself and others. There are three key conclusions to keep in mind. First, apply positive feedback to enhance commitment and negative feedback to highlight slow progress. Second, set near-term goal targets; people work faster and better at the beginning and end than in the middle. Finally, do not underestimate the value of immediate, certain, and intrinsic incentives – but also recognize when they might fail. Selecting the best motivational tool is not just an art – it’s a science.</p></div></div><div></div></div>",

        "content": "<p>APRIL 04, 2016 — Deepak Malhotra — HBR</p><div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div> In my new book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Impossible-Deadlocks-Resolve-Conflicts/dp/1626566976\" target=\"_blank\">Negotiating the Impossible</a>, I offer numerous principles and tactics for negotiating effectively when things get ugly — especially when you don’t have sufficient “money or muscle” to use as leverage. This could be a deadlocked deal, an escalating conflict, or any situation where there is mistrust, antagonism, or a seeming unwillingness to engage in good faith.</div><p>Many of the lessons are just as useful for knocking down the more common barriers people face in negotiation.  Here are three common “hardball” tactics that the other side might use — and some advice on how to respond.</p><p><strong>Tactic #1: “We will never…”</strong></p><p><strong>What You Do:</strong>My response to any ultimatum — regardless of the type of negotiation or how the ultimatum was delivered — is usually quite simple: I completely ignore it. I don’t ask people to repeat or clarify ultimatums. Why? Many ultimatums are not true deal-breakers. Sometimes people are just emotional, or trying to assert control, or using strong language in an attempt to gain advantage. In such these cases, it will be easier for them to back down later if you have not engaged with or legitimized the ultimatum.  How so? There may come a day — a week from now, a month from now, or years from now — when the other side realizes that what they said they could never do, they must do, or is actually in their best interest to do. When that day comes, the last thing I need is for them to remember me having heard them say they will never do so — because then they will not be able to say “yes” without losing face.  Too often, people will escalate matters, and even sacrifice their own best interests, if that’s the only way for them to save face.  If ignoring an ultimatum is not possible, you want to reframe their statement as a non-ultimatum before continuing.  For example, if they say “I will never do this,” I might respond as follows: “I can understand, given where we are today, this would be very difficult for you to do…”  This way, I’ve given them two ways out.  This would be “very difficult”, not impossible, and their reluctance is “given where we are today,” not forever.</p><p><strong>Tactic #2: “Just one more thing…”</strong></p><p><strong>What You Do:</strong> It can be really frustrating when people keep adding new conditions when you think a deal has been struck. When it happens, it’s important to distinguish between two (of multiple) possibilities. They might think you are too committed to making the deal and are trying to take advantage of this. Or, their additional demands are truly important to them and they need you to agree. You have multiple options, but here is something that I do often: I explain that if something is truly important to them, I want to understand why and work with them to accommodate their legitimate concerns. But I am not willing to negotiate an individual issue in isolation — especially at this late stage in the negotiation. If they need adjustments, we will also have to discuss what kinds of concessions they are willing to make in exchange. If this is really important to them, they should be willing to show flexibility on other issues of value to me.</p><p><strong>Tactic #3: “Great! Now let me double-check with my boss…”</strong></p><p><strong>What You Do: </strong>One piece of advice I give often is to <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2015%2F13%2Fcontrol-the-negotiation-before-it-begins\" target=\"_blank\">negotiate process before substance</a>.  For example: you’ve been negotiating for months, and just when you think the deal is done, they tell you that they need another six months, or that others need to sign off on it, or that they are now going to shop around your offer.  Many of these problems stem from a failure of not having negotiated process before substance. In other words, before getting too deep into deal terms, you want to get more information about (and try to shape) the process — i.e. how you will get from where you are today to the finish line.  This includes discussing questions such as: How long does it take an organization like yours to do a deal like this? Who are all the people who need to be on board? What might speed up or slow down the process?  What will we discuss in the meeting next week, and when will we cover the other concerns we have?  When you negotiate process before substance, you make it less likely that you make substance mistakes later on.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>",

She is the founder of <a href=\"http://www.anyesvanrhijn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Success Own Your Own Terms</a> where she helps professional women realise their full potential and design a professional life that sustains the life they want for themselves and those around them.</em></p><p><strong>What is your career path?</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;ve spent 25 years in the corporate world, mainly as a Director of administration in consulting and IT. Around 40 I had that nagging feeling, I knew I wanted to do something else but didn&rsquo;t know what. I ended up following 3 different coaching trainings and finally decided to set up my own business as an executive coach.</p><p>Over the years I had developed my own holistic coaching framework. After a few years I realized that I loved my work but didn&rsquo;t enjoy doing it in a corporate setting. I revisited my framework, replaced the career components of it by business modules and decided to work with entrepreneurs and small business owners.</p><div>Today I help professional women do three things : 1) I help them break their self-imposed glass ceiling to become a woman of influence 2) I help them transform their passion into a fulfilling business 3) I help them work ON their business and no longer in it.</div><p>Life then challenged me a few years ago and I had to start my life all over again. But instead of stepping into victimhood, I decided to see this as a unique opportunity to reconsider all my choices in life and business. That is how I decided to move to London and on July 21<sup>st</sup>, 2016 I arrived in London without any income and technically homeless. But that didn&rsquo;t stop me, instead of focusing on the fear I focused on my vision. Six months later I was already up and running again! Beside my own work at Success On Your Own Terms, I&rsquo;m leading a female network in Central London and I&rsquo;m still hosting my weekly video interview series The Women Who Make Things Happen Show that I had started from France two years ago.</p><p><strong>Today, we define ourselves by work. Should we change this relationship to work? Separate life and work?</strong></p><p>That is a challenging question. I believe that the very first thing we must do is to focus on what works for us, what is true to us. Most of us grew up pushed in a direction that is not necessarily the one we would have chosen. It is important that we start making conscious choices. You need to be clear about what you want for your life. I&rsquo;m passionate about what I&rsquo;m doing and therefore work doesn&rsquo;t feel like work even if I often work a lot. We are in a very connected world and the borders between life and work are sometimes very thin, but that connectivity should be an asset not a burden. I know for myself that I have no problem working over the weekend if need be but I&rsquo;m also choosing to have &ldquo;me&rdquo; time during the week. That&rsquo;s what I love about being my own boss. So yes, it has completely changed my relationship to work.</p><p><strong>What do you say to someone who want to start his own business?</strong></p><p>Quitting a job can be a scary move. But if you know this is the right choice for you, go for it. Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you your dream is impossible. The people who care for you will be afraid to see you fail and they will try to stop you. It won&rsquo;t necessarily be an easy journey but the key is mindset. Focus on what works, don&rsquo;t let challenges stop you and get support from someone who has been there before.</p><p><strong>You also work on women empowerment, what are the limits imposed to women nowadays?</strong></p><p>This is a very complex question and there isn&rsquo;t one simple and easy answer. I&rsquo;m choosing to approach it from the angle of the glass ceiling women are creating themselves. Why they are doing so is a whole subject by and on itself but the thing is that very often women are struggling with self-confidence and self-worth challenges. For example, a man will apply for a job if he meets 60% of the criteria where a woman thinks she must meet all (or almost all) criteria to apply. They are also more often than men subject to the limiting power of fear. We all face fear but it is possible to turn it into a fuel instead of letting it paralyze us.</p><p>Too frequently also women who reach a position of power will tend to behave as men. That can be explained by the absence of role models and by the fact that the system has been designed by men for men, but you don&rsquo;t have to act like a man if you want to succeed. I believe that men and women complement each other in the work place and a better balance of feminine and masculine energy from both sides is what is really needed.</p><p>The other thing that women often have is to believe that whatever challenges they are facing they are the only ones facing them. It is therefore important to share our stories. That is what I&rsquo;m doing with my Women Who Make Things Happen Show.</p><p>And then there is of course the relationship that women have with family. Women are natural caretakers but things are also shifting in that field. Millennium men increasingly want to be involved as well in the family, they want to be involved in children education. A real paradigm shift is what is really needed here also.</p><p><strong>A last advice for stressed consultants?</strong></p><p>Breathe! Be clear about who you are and what is important to you. Live according to your values. Be clear about your needs and have strong boundaries. Make conscious choices. Work smarter, not harder.</p>",

Typically, these include policy benchmarking and design, mobility programme reviews and transformation, supply-chain and total global mobility cost optimisation.</em></p><p></p><p><strong>What do you think are the current big trends in relocation ?</strong></p><p>Big trends are a move away from the long term expatriate missions, and an increase in short term businesses : 30% are short term assignments. Long-term missions slowly reduce.</p><p>The second big trend is organizations working with women in expatriation. There are many more females who want to move, there are 17% to 33% female expatriate. It shows that the traditional family model is changing.</p><p></p><p><strong>There is a significant rise of freelancers, do you think it will change something in the business ? Does it increase the use of relocation ?</strong></p><p>This is one of the questions we answer. The reports say there is going to be more virtual assignments. More and more knowledge workers, not using internal resources in a traditional way, but in a more contingent way. As an individual you may move more.</p><p>In term of hot spots. The countries sought are China, USA, UK, Singapore, Germany. They are moving from USA, UK, China, France, Germany, Australia. So these countries are both sending and receiving.</p><p>People talk about South America. But it still has challenges. We are going to see a high growth of emergent countries in the next years. It is a challenge, many talents are going to leave Asia.</p><p></p><p><strong>With digitalization, we speak about digital nomads, will it change the organization of companies ? </strong></p><p>First, some industries are more difficult to become nomad. There are some where you can work remotely.</p><p>But people will still be focused on delivery. There is a new generation of people who can work more virtually. If you are in a factory, you cannot work remotely, if you are a consultant it is possible.</p><p></p><p><strong>Are companies integrating nomadism ? </strong></p><p>Services firms are more open to that. It gives flexibility, which is better for family life, for women for example.</p><p>For example, there is a woman who is a forensic scientist. She has 3 children. But the employer doesn’t care. There are just some things she has to deliver in time. But she is free to work whenever she wants.</p><p></p><p><strong>Today, digitalization allows to work from anywhere, but companies locate close to big metropolis. This concentration is paradoxical, don’t you think ?</strong></p><p>The challenge is that you still need to have interaction. People want to be in the smart place, with convenient utilities, entertainment, a cultural life, good schools… People also need to meet at work. Sometimes you need to have face to face.</p><p>You also need to have technology centers, where a physical proximity is possible. It depends on the industry sector. Some will be impacted by digital, some jobs will change.</p><p>The other aspect of digitalization is social media. Companies have internet to connect people, the knowledge becomes available. There will be a blowing of corporate barriers between the different regions of the world. The network will give people a power to negotiate their conditions better.</p><p>If you are a company, you can also use your network to create a strong corporate identity, even if you have remote employees. Increasingly, there will be big digital communities. This is the value of the social media : they have a strong digital brand.</p>",

Social media platforms evolved to support rich content, even providing video streaming and video chat capabilities. Innovation is more than merely using advanced technology never before seen in the market place. Innovation requires the purposeful adaptation of technology in a new way to meet an extant business challenge.</p><p>In the past, we communicated with physical paper and in-person exchanges. Today, we are increasingly communicating through online platforms. Now, we have greater visibility in the community, and it has become easier to make contact. With the digital age, the ability to expand networks has also been greatly improved, and the relationships formed within those networks are significantly strengthened.</p><p>For example, today, in a context of fragmentation of the labor market, with the rise of freelancers and self-employed people, it is difficult to focus on both your core activity and business development. But digital platforms allow to accompany this societal shift.</p><p>We met Jan Ondrus, an expert on digital networks, who got his PhD in Information Systems in Switzerland at HEC Lausanne, and who then joined the ESSEC business school in 2007 as a teacher researcher. According to Jan Ondrus : &ldquo; There are many platforms available to help link employees with new employers. As with Uber, the client and the worker are matched automatically, and this is the same for dating sites Digitalization has made it much easier for people to connect. There is a matching between supply and demand. Many platforms can link experienced workers with companies looking to hire&mdash;this has cut down on time spent looking for employees, as well as time looking for a job.&rdquo;</p><p>This influence of digital networks on the professional sphere is not limited to dedicated platforms, even social networks initially limited to the personal sphere have more and more a professional and commercial functions.</p><p>For Jan Ondrus: &ldquo;Increasingly, companies are realizing the benefit of connecting with their target customers through social networks and online interaction. Maintaining an online relationship with your customers has a positive effect on business, but it does require that companies are constantly available to their audience. Additionally, online customer service is now being embraced by many low-cost companies. For example, Sosh uses online networks to connect with their customers as it reduces the cost of customer support. However, this tactic primarily targets a very specific, younger generation.&rdquo;</p><p>But today, this strategic position of social networks seems to be monopolized by huge, institutionalized networks. The question is whether this movement of concentration is called to move or not.</p><p>According to Jan Ondrus: &ldquo;Some companies are so large that it seems like nearly everyone utilizes these networks, so there appears to be no problem. But, say, if a platform develops a problem or does not keep up with new technological advances, people will stop using it and the company will fall quickly. Myspace or Msn, for example, were once very large platforms and people also left very quickly. The number one Social Network in India was Orkut, its growth curve was exponential, but suddenly the network crashed and now the company is dead. So things can change very quickly.</p><p>There is also a term known as a switching cost. This refers to whether a platform can migrate the contents of an old platform to a new one. Major networks continually work on new innovations. The hope is to gain new members, while trying to reach a critical mass to survive. This critical mass is rather theoretical. Some networks can operate with few people, other need more.</p><p>Smaller platforms may also utilize larger ones to help gain their audience. For example, Farmville relied on Facebook to develop their community. So a little network can grow through a larger network. What is the value people have if the network grows? It is important that people find interest to stay. One of the great added values of a network, more than the content you put into it, is the new functionalities we invent.&rdquo;</p><p>Today, we more and more speak about the concept of the plateformization of economy, a phenomenon which may be called to permeate our whole society. We then wonder what the difference between a network and a platform is, and what upheaval it can induce.</p><p>For Jan Ondrus: &ldquo;The term of platform is not yet fully defined; though researchers have worked on it for years. We talk about platform ecosystems. The platform is what intermediate between people, it is the centerpiece of the network. But there can also be many platforms in one eco-system. If you take a network, it can be built thanks to a platform, or around a platform. In fact, the platform is the central element that allows the exchange of information Compared to the network, the platform is at the same time an element of the network and a modality of the network.</p<p>Internet of Things is also a great change. There is an increasingly strong interaction between people and objects. We will all become nodes, nodes that are objects, other people. There are also platforms that tend to become de facto monopolies quickly. The platform that succeeds will be the one that generates the largest network the quickest.&rdquo;</p><p>To summarize, there is actually a plateformization in the economy. What inspires companies to ask a question is whether all companies must reinvent themselves. Even traditional companies like Dannon and Areva must think about redefining their brand. They are not operators of platforms like Uber who focus mainly on their platform. They have other activities, so they cannot change everything, but they can learn from the platform to introduce fluidity and improve certain processes. For example platforms that could facilitate exchanges with manufacturers&hellip;</p><p>BtoB platforms are less visible, but it already exists and it is a new model, maybe an omen of an economic revolution.</p>",

        "content": "<p>FEBRUARY 19, 2016 &mdash; Alicia Bassuk and Jodi Glickman &mdash; HBR</p><div>According to Elon Musk, a good way to tell if a candidate is fibbing about his or her qualifications is whether they can use a personal story to illustrate a particularly telling experience. &ldquo;If someone was really the person that solved a problem, they&rsquo;ll be able to answer the question on multiple levels,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-job-interview-rule-2013-13\" target=\"_blank\">he says</a>. &ldquo;Anyone who really solves a problem never forgets it.&rdquo;</div><div><p>Whether it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re hiding something, or because they&rsquo;re just plain nervous, job candidates often offer canned responses. One option is to dismiss the person outright, but you may actually be missing out on a great candidate who&rsquo;s instinctively gravitating toward answers to questions they spent time preparing.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re willing to dig in, take a few risks, or change tactics, you can get a better sense of the real person behind the candidate, and to catch a glimpse of what it would be like to work together. After all, when you get someone to show vulnerability and share a personal challenge that took them outside of their comfort zone, you open up a whole new window into the person sitting across the table from you &mdash; or in the case of Musk, identify important warning signs.</p><p>Here are three ways to gain insight beyond the resume, beyond the prepared responses, beyond the typical, &ldquo;tell me about a time you failed&rdquo; questions.</p><p><strong>Practice on-the-spot coaching</strong>. Let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;re interviewing Maria for a chief of staff position. Previously, Maria was a fundraiser for a non-profit. She is professional, articulate, sharp, and enthusiastic.</p><p>If Maria is answering your questions too succinctly and you&rsquo;d like to hear more depth in her answers, give her a coaching directive:</p><p>&ldquo;Maria, can you please answer the same question by telling me a story with an arc?&rdquo;</p><p>If Maria stumbles, or can&rsquo;t seem to answer a seemingly simple question, such as &ldquo;can you describe your leadership style?&rdquo; give her a different coaching directive:</p><p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s change the question. How would your staff describe your leadership style?&rdquo;</p><p>By giving Maria some on the spot coaching, you can assess several character traits:</p><ol><li>Does Maria understand the feedback? Does she &ldquo;get it&rdquo; quickly and is she able to take action and redirect in the moment?</li><li>Is she receptive to your feedback, or defensive?</li><li>Does she know how to ask clarifying questions?</li><li>Does she integrate the feedback into the rest of the interview &mdash; or does she continue to offer succinct answers or stories without an arc?</li></ol><p>If your answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; to any of the above questions, it may give you pause about giving Maria the thumbs up to head to the next round of interviews.</p><div> </div><p><strong>Interview candidates in a group.</strong> <a href=\"http://voiceglance.com/how-southwest-hires-taking-fun-seriously/\" target=\"_blank\">Southwest Airlines</a> invites groups of people to interview for flight attendant positions at one time, largely to observe the social interactions among candidates during a naturally high-stress situation. Interviewers then ratchet up the stress level by cold-calling specific candidates to answer questions, and creating scenarios which strain social dynamics &mdash; such as giving candidates opportunities to prove themselves without throwing others under the bus.</p><p>The interviewers then sit back and watch the situation play out, getting answers to such questions as:</p><ol><li>Who emerges as a natural leader, building on the strengths of others or changing the flow of dialogue for the better?</li><li>Who challenges and brings out the best in others?</li><li>Who personifies the spirit and culture of Southwest &mdash; taking their work, but not themselves, too seriously?</li><li>Did someone find a way to disagree without doing so at the expense of another candidate?</li></ol><p>Conversely, those who are challenged by the collaboration will likely miss out on opportunities to add value to the conversation. They may contradict another candidate or isolate themselves from social interactions before or after the group interview.</p><p><strong>Test the fit.</strong> Lastly, the interview is a perfect time to test the cultural fit of the candidate. Vosges, a company that sells artisan chocolates and that one of us has worked with, evokes a brand that is hip and creative. This leads some candidates to expect a flexible workplace (i.e. working from home) with little to no face-time. In fact, Vosges&rsquo; culture is built on the energy that comes from all employees working in pods throughout the office, and meetings held in beautifully decorated rooms adjacent to the factory floor.</p><p>Asking people detailed questions about culture is an effective way to expose work preferences, assumptions, and biases. When a candidate says they&rsquo;re looking for an entrepreneurial culture, ask them to define what that means, using stories from their past or specific examples about what they want in the future. Do they read &ldquo;entrepreneurial&rdquo; to mean a culture that allows employees to run their own group as an independent business, or does it signal a workspace with whiteboard walls and beanbag chairs? Is a culture with a strong sense of community one that offers a general sense of collegiality and group lunches, or one that encourages and creates opportunities for community service and social activities outside the office?</p><p>A similar thing happens at Coyote Logistics. Their head of marketing says the company give candidates a manual about its culture, and then ask them to articulate the ways in which it&rsquo;s fit for them &mdash; and ways in which they will enrich it if hired. They want to make sure candidates know what they are signing up for and that&rsquo;s good for both the company and the potential employee.</p><p>On the spot coaching, group interviewing, and cultural fit dialogue gives you more and better information about your candidates. It also ensures that you&rsquo;ll find stronger employees whose skill sets and mission align with your organization because you&rsquo;ve seen beyond the resume and beyond the prepared responses. You&rsquo;ve both vetted one another on a deeper level &mdash; making for better hiring and happier employees in the long-run.</p></div><p> </p>",

        "content": "<p>MARCH 01, 2016 &mdash; Scott Edinger &mdash; HBR<br /> Sales professionals make decisions every day about what prospects and customers they will be meeting with, what products or services they will highlight in their pitches, and even what elements of your value proposition they will emphasize. McKinsey &amp; Co. research on B2B purchases indicates that 25% of the buying decision depends on the interaction with the sales professional. That puts your strategy in the hands of inexperienced company strategists who are focused, often solely, on how to reach a quota.</p><p>Are you comfortable with that? If not, there are three things you should do to make sure that your salespeople understand and implement your strategy as you intended it, and that their actions are in line with your goals, not just the target they want to make.</p><p>Make sure your salespeople pursue the right leads. A global consulting firm I work with has an explicit strategy to target Fortune 1000 companies, yet less than 15% of their business comes from those companies. Many companies in my experience have a similar disconnect between their intended market or customer type and their actual client base. That&rsquo;s because when your sales people are trying to make a number, any business looks like good business. Sometimes it makes sense for your sales team to be opportunistic and acquire business outside of your ideal client profile, especially low-hanging fruit. But if a majority of your clients are not within that profile, you&rsquo;re simply not pursuing your strategy.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a reason you chose those target markets or customer types. Likely you&rsquo;ve learned that those are the clients who&rsquo;ll place the highest value on your offering, and be willing to pay a premium. If you want to realize the growth that strategy promises, you need to direct most pursuit efforts at acquiring the right clients. Define territories carefully (by geography, industry or simply named accounts) and be sure your sales team is focusing there. Be vigilant about which organizations you are marketing to, and ensure that lead distribution reflects the space in the market where you expect to win. Make sure that CRM data on prospects isn&rsquo;t populated with companies that are outside of your target market. And require a clear rationale from any salesperson pursuing leads that don&rsquo;t match your ideal client profile; don&rsquo;t let your salespeople chase just any easy deal.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a balancing act. But remember, every hour spent developing an opportunity that&rsquo;s outside your sweet spot is a non-strategic use of time, energy, and resources.</p><p>When strategy shifts, make sure that sales shifts with it. An Inc. 500 technology distribution company I&rsquo;m working with has expanded its offerings to include services like installation and hardware management. It&rsquo;s a smart move for the business but if that strategy is going to get traction, the sales team has to make a significant shift. Instead of calling on IT managers or purchasing staff to buy equipment, they&rsquo;ll need to start talking with senior managers all the way up to the CIO. Sales teams must identify those buyers, understand what&rsquo;s important to them, and be comfortable in conversations with these executives. Changing customer targets represents a massive shift for many sales professionals, and often they try to stick with old approaches&mdash;calling on familiar contacts who don&rsquo;t have the authority to make the new purchasing decisions or who can only agree to smaller, transactional purchases. By spending their efforts on buyers who can&rsquo;t say yes to your new value proposition, the sales force can undermine your strategy.</p><p>Focus the team on creating value beyond the products and services it sells. While the concept of consultative or &ldquo;solution&rdquo; selling is decades old, it&rsquo;s surprising how few salespeople (even very sophisticated high-level sellers) do it. I&rsquo;ve observed over 1,000 sales calls, and I still hear more old-school pitching than in-depth discussions about the client&rsquo;s needs. Unless your strategy is to be the lowest cost provider, your sellers need to do more than communicate the advantages of your products and services; they need to be part of the advantage. That requires having deep conversations about the client&rsquo;s objectives, and providing insights about problems and opportunities they may not have recognized &mdash; and how the seller&rsquo;s solution can help. This isn&rsquo;t a new idea but it is still not the default setting for most sales professionals, and it needs to be. (For more detail, see my article, &ldquo;How a sales force creates value.&rdquo;)</p><p>Bottom line: Don&rsquo;t assume that just because you&rsquo;ve shared your company&rsquo;s strategy with the sales team and done some training that the team is going to effectively translate that into their sales approach. If you want your team to bring your strategy to life, work closely with sales leaders and their teams to help them see how their decisions, focus, and specific behaviors make the strategy succeed or fail.</p>",

The idea was to structure the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the U.S. to help French entrepreneurs tackle US market, and to build a very upscale personal network. We have a network of founders, entrepreneurs and representatives of large French groups. As members have little time, they rely on the community. We facilitate exchanges between members by organizing meetings in one-to-one settings.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is the DNA of French Founders?</strong></p><p>The idea is really to be an international network of French entrepreneurs. There is a dimension of influence diplomacy, a way to promote French techniques and innovations. Sometimes we work with Business France and French Tech, as it can serve our members.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sometimes there is a cultural gap between France and the USA. How do you </strong><strong>prepare French entrepreneurs to enter this cultural gap?</strong></p><p>French entrepreneurs must prepare for the transition to the American market. For those who want to settle in New York, we put them in touch with people who are in their field for a long time. It allows for personalized feedback, because attitudes and methods of operation are often specialized in each sector.</p><p> </p><p><strong>By animating a French network abroad, don&rsquo;t you think there could be a risk of communitarianism?</strong></p><p>No, on the contrary, the goal is to work with everyone, unite companies under a French brand. This, then, opens doors abroad because France has a good reputation in tech and luxury. It is rather an asset, it saves time.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How do you use digital tools to increase the power of your network?</strong></p><p>We have a complete digital space available to our members, and an algorithm to facilitate the linking between members and creating opportunities. For example, if we have a company in our network that is fundraising, all network investors will be directly notified.</p><p>Today, after 2 years of operation, we have more than 1,500 active members. And the extension is quick, as members of the network sponsor others. So there&rsquo;s a domino effect ; this is how we spread in Asia. We have three offices in London and New York, and we will open an office in Shanghai and Singapore.</p><p>The goal now is to continue to expand the network intelligently, being selective with new members, which should be pro-active, contribute to the network and give it added value.</p>",

        "title": "Deborah Le Bloas",
        "content": "<p><em>Deborah Le Bloas has had a career in communication and media. She is now commercial director of <a href=\"http://www.latribune.fr\">La Tribune</a>. A newspaper on finance and economy which also organizes many events.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>What is your career path ?</strong></p><p>To begin with, my background is a bit atypical for a sales manager as I have a postgraduate degree in cultural mediation. Though irregular, this degree has helped me in business as it relates to people and connections. My career has also largely been built on relationships and affinities.</p><p>I began at 18 years old at a small job, within the Association of Krav Maga in Paris, working with the main representative of this discipline in Europe. I fell in love with the project, and I developed, as the General Secretary, French and European federations of Krav Maga in the four years that followed. I then got in touch with Skyrock. I helped them organize a festival of martial art films, which never emerged, but they liked the approach and they recruited me as their advertising manager to develop the turnover on entertainment.</p><p>After 2 years, through a spontaneous recommendation from one of my clients from the Wanadoo portal, I got recruited and spent 18 months with them. Soon after, the Chief of AlloCin&eacute; recruited me as Director of Advertising in 2006. In 2008, anticipating the repositioning of the display market, I proposed to set up a special operations division (multichannel communication devices: web, land, print, etc.). I was director of this division for 7 years. Then I was hired as a Business Manager at Wizbii, a job platform for young people. And eventually in 2016, my previous boss from Skyrock hired me as the commercial director of the Media Hub of La Tribune.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is the function of a network today? Does this notion change with the digital age?</strong></p><p>It depends on what the network is based on. My network is essentially built on the sharing of strong human values. It is composed of people who, regardless of professional goals, care to integrate to their thinking the human dimension of their contacts (employees, manager, customer &hellip;). We all share the belief that personnal development, and even joy, presides not only to the success of a project, but contributes to individual and collective progress. My network is both personnal and professionnal , and therefore its function has always been the same: advancing with individuals who share a certain vision of the world, and combine their skills to achieve it.</p><p>Today, we have the ability to share personally using Facebook, and share professionally using LinkedIn. This is a new type of network becuase people are able to share both personally and proffessionally. Perhaps this environment complicates the typical structure and function of a network, which are primarily focused on individual and punctual interests. This, then, is the idea of e-reputation.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How to build an active and effective network?</strong></p><p>For efficiency, I think it&rsquo;s important to have total confidence in your skills. Those who seek or recommend you, should know exactly why they do it, including the benefits and limitations. We must be clear about our desires and clear about our possibilities.</p><p>Helping is a great way to keep your network active. Doing a post on the success of a project or contributing to a discussion allows to exist, but only intellectually, with less emotion in the memory of your audience.</p><p>To commit your conviction by connecting individuals, needs and their resolution, basing your recommendation on a recognized expertise and non-cognitive skills that made sense, the famous soft skills, is more prominent and lively, these practices maintain the power flow in the network.</p><p> </p><p><strong>In a context of fragmentation of the labor market, with the rise of freelance and self-employed entrepreneurs, it is difficult to focus on both your core activity and business development. How can digital networks can facilitate this process?</strong></p><p>By their characteristics:</p><p>&ndash; Immediacy: people have a natural tendency to help and to feel empathy, especially in the age where is only takes one click to help. Thus one can have access to a tenfold visibility, thanks to the simple sharing features.</p><p>&ndash; Agility: we can respond, comment, suggest, change at breakneck speed, and be connected with other people in seconds. This is a simple truth, but it holds crazy power: notifications. Your contacts / friends are your best sales people.</p><p>&ndash; Community: get on the path of a large number of users by communicating on your work through posts. The question is rather the lack of qualification because the spread of information is anarchic, but it can be considered that the amount will compensate partially.</p><p>That said, we only talk here about how these networks facilitate the process, but that does not obliterate the necessary identification of qualified contacts.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can media like newspapers be subject to a change of use or nature when they migrate to a digital medium? For example, becoming a community platform where the exchange of information gets horizontalized. How to support this transition ?</strong></p><p>The priority, in my opinion, is to accompany users, especially younger ones, who should be educated to curation, auditing, and information confrontation. I further wonder about the shift of learning. Previously we cared to learn linearly, vertically. Now we have to worry about learning to learn, this direct access to the information implies to sort and classify horizontal information. What this means in media is getting back to the ethics, responsibility and kindness, because if the info is horizontalized and shared by users, it was nevertheless pushed by media in the first place. I recently heard the term &ldquo;mental malnutrition,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s what accompaniment has to solve.</p>",

There&rsquo;s no denying that advancements have been made. But one thing is also clear: we are not there yet.</p><div><p></p><p>OCTOBER 1, 2016</p><p>For 200 years women have been fighting for equal rights. Parity is still not perfect, and from my generation&rsquo;s perspective (X), the fight is not over yet. Many feminist organizations work tirelessly to reduce gender inequalities, denounce discrimination, and reduce violence against women, all typical &ldquo;sexist&rdquo; things from men.<br /> These organizations have been widely successful in advocating for women&rsquo;s rights. We have since been permitted to go to school (1836), to vote, to abort, to exercise the same parental authority, to promote equal access for women and men to electoral mandates and elective offices, to reduce wage inequalities and to ensure that motherhood is not a barrier to their career development (2004). I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s because the road was long and full of pitfalls, but 200 years later it is clear that there is still some work to do! 31 million girls across the world did not attend school in 2014. 70% of people living below the poverty line are women and there are only 9.5% women at the head of a government or a state. Interestingly, women do 2/3 of the total number of global working hours and help produce more than half of the food; but earn only 10% of total income, own less than 2% of the land, and receive less than 5% of banking loans.<br /> And even closer to home, there is this figure: 80% of employees consider women to face sexist attitudes at the office! Does this &ldquo;ordinary sexism&rdquo; offend you? Just imagine the level of discrimination faced by homosexual women, women of foreign origin, or women whose weight / height ratio is above that dictated by the media or Instagram. It has to stop! These offensive phrases are now used as jokes jokes. In 2016 the racist, sexist, and despotic jokes should not make anyone laugh. It is not only question of feminism, it is about tolerance, respect, acceptance, and inclusion.<br /> I heard my 14 year old daughter say that feminism is finished and that equality is achieved. When I told her that women are paid less than men, she answered me &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry! That was before!&rdquo;</p><p>So I asked myself, &ldquo;Is the idea of feminism outdated?&rdquo; Are all these pro-women groups, at some point, going to be anti-productive by perpetuating the gap rather than reducing it? To further examine what my daughter&mdash;who was raised without sexed toys (Barbies, household kit, etc.) and no pink in her room&mdash;said, I interviewed several girls 16 to 20 years with a specific question : &ldquo;Is gender equality a concern for women nowadays? &rdquo; Surprisingly, the majority responded with a no. They we are grateful for our fight but no longer see themselves as different or inferior to men.</p><p></p><p>Their perspective is in large contrast with the women of Generation X. They have clearly identified the dichotomy that exists between our feminist discourse and our &ldquo;over-involvement in our homes and our family duties at home.&rdquo; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine to say you&rsquo;re a feminist when you do most household duties and the man still does not know how to change a diaper or store the plates.&rdquo;</p><p>There is, unfortunately, some truth to that. In France, 77% of household tasks are done by women, and around the rest of the world, women bear the majority of domestic work.<br /> Inequality is everywhere, including in our homes.</p><p></p><p>Household tasks, logistics, and the education of children must be shared between the parents so that, both man and woman, can pursue their professional careers.<br /> That being said, don&rsquo;t beat yourself up if you cannot balance your personal and professional lives. It is impossible to balance two things that do not have the same value. A personal life has emotional value and a professional life has primarily material value. The term &ldquo;personal life&rdquo; systematically refers to family life. However, I don&rsquo;t consider my family the limits of my personal life. My personal life but includes socializing, being a woman, playing sports, my friends, and my daughter&rsquo;s life. I do not want my professional life to interfere with all of those things. I much prefer to balance the two! And besides isn&rsquo;t that the purpose of all our women&rsquo;s groups? To harmoniously juggle the many battles we face like sexism, racism, homophobia, and disabilities, just to name a few&hellip; all to change the world.</p></div>",

        "content": "<p>MARCH 29, 2016 &mdash; Duncan Coombe &mdash; HBR</p><div><div>I was recently working with a leader who had just lost a much-valued employee to a competitor. He had invested a large amount of time in mentoring and training the person and had high hopes and expectations for his career. The employee was someone clearly identified as &ldquo;top talent&rdquo; within the company &mdash; and what&rsquo;s more, the resignation came as a complete surprise. The team leader was feeling let down and annoyed.</div><div><div><div><p>&ldquo;I guess the conclusion I have come to,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that I just mustn&rsquo;t take this personally.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s a sentiment we have all often heard in work contexts: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it personally&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s not personal, it&rsquo;s business.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve heard it said about feedback, conflict, difficult conversations, restructuring, losing deals, collaboration, dealing with career ups and downs &mdash; all kinds of daily workplace issues.</p><p>And yet it&rsquo;s an absurd idea.</p><p>Work is the place where I&rsquo;m going to spend the bulk of my waking hours &mdash; indeed, the bulk of my life &mdash; and yet I&rsquo;m not supposed to take it personally? I should accept the idea that the bulk of my life from twentysomething to sixtysomething is somehow not personal?</p><p>While I fully understand that by &ldquo;not taking it personally&rdquo; we are better able to protect ourselves in work contexts that can often be challenging, threatening, and relentless, there are benefits to making our work, leadership, and followership personal.</p><p>The first relates to success and well-being at work. Take a moment and think about the people you&rsquo;ve encountered whom you consider inspired, energized, and successful. They probably take work personally. And the flip side is that the people who have depersonalized their work are probably not the people you have enjoyed working with. Your own experience thus indicates that success seems to be linked to taking your work personally.</p><p>But this is not just about nuanced language and personal psychology; it is also about real business results. Consider the connection between engaged employees and business performance. What is engagement if not &ldquo;taking it personally&rdquo;? And when we consider the <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2013%2F10%2Fmap-the-sad-state-of-global-workplace-engagement\" target=\"_blank\">low levels of reported workplace engagement</a>, it becomes clear that &ldquo;not taking it personally&rdquo; can have real costs.</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s ethics. &ldquo;Not taking it personally&rdquo; lies at the heart of many corporate ethics scandals, from embezzling and accounting fraud to issues of worker safety and environmental protection. It&rsquo;s when executives and teams adopt the mindless notion of &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not personal, it&rsquo;s business&rdquo; that they absolve themselves of their responsibilities as social actors, custodians of the planet, and guardians of the well-being of their employees, customers, and communities.</p><p>For these reasons and more, it seems clear to me that if we are to fulfill our responsibilities and obligations as executives &mdash; and our potential as leaders &mdash; we need to take things deeply personally. Put simply, a dehumanized and depersonalized workforce is more likely to treat its multiple stakeholders poorly.</p><p>Now, of course there is a big, big difference between taking it personally and not being able to manage your boundaries. There is a distinction between having passion for your job and attaching so much self-worth to it that you are not able to protect yourself psychologically, where every mishap and mistake is taken <em>so</em> personally that it penetrates the core of your self-esteem. If work becomes too dominant a part of your identity, that can also <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2015%2F08%2Fis-overwork-killing-you\" target=\"_blank\">be dangerous</a>.</p><p>But surely there&rsquo;s an appropriate happy medium to be found, a place somewhere between workaholism and anaesthetising the spirit.</p><div> </div><p>Going back to our manager at the beginning of this article, I wish I had said a few things to him: Don&rsquo;t beat yourself up about it. Don&rsquo;t overly introject this as a failure that is a representation of your value and worth as a person. Your life and your career are not defined by this. But do be disappointed.

        "content": "<p>MAY 11, 2016 &mdash; Brandon Rigoni and Amy Adkins &mdash; HBR</p><div> </div><div>Millennials, it seems, really are the job hoppers people say they are. Those born between 1980 and 1996 are the most likely to look for and change jobs, according to Gallup&rsquo;s new report &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/reports/189830/millennials-work-live.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">How Millennials Want to Work and Live</a>.&rdquo;</div><div><div><p>Our research &mdash; which provides an in-depth look at what defines Millennials as employees, people, and consumers &mdash; both confirms and casts aside some of the myths about this particular generation. It paints a nuanced picture that can help inform companies looking to hire and retain Millennial employees &mdash; a group that is now <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/04/25/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/\" target=\"_blank\">the largest generation</a> in the U.S.</p><p>On the job-hopping question, we found that 21% of Millennial workers had left their job in the last year to do something else, a number that is more than three times higher than that of non-Millennials who report doing the same.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t have data on what these Millennials left to do; it&rsquo;s possible some may have decided to continue their education, for example. But six in ten Millennials also say they are open to different job opportunities, which is again the highest percentage among all generations in the workplace. And these opportunities are not within their current company: A separate <a target=\"_blank\">study</a> <a>shows</a>that an overwhelming majority of all workers &mdash; 93% &mdash; say they left their employer the last time they changed roles. Only about 7% took a new position in their company.</p><p>Why? Well, we know that American workers aren&rsquo;t particularly engaged at work as a whole. And Millennials lead the pack: 71% are either not engaged or actively disengaged at work, making them <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/181289/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">the least engaged generation</a> in the U.S. Moreover, engagement is essential to retaining employees. Our analysis reveals that 47% of actively disengaged Millennials strongly agree that they will switch jobs if the job market improves in the next 12 months, compared with 17% of engaged Millennials.</p><p>On the flip side, Millennials&rsquo; willingness to switch jobs and companies presents a substantial attraction opportunity for organizations. Ultimately, Millennials are consumers of the workplace. They shop around for the jobs that best align with their needs and life goals. More than ever, employers need to know and act on the factors that make their company appealing to these candidates. They have to make it easy for prospects to <em>choose</em> them over their competition.</p><p>But what exactly do Millennials look for in their job searches?</p><p>We asked workers how important particular attributes were to them when applying for new jobs. Here&rsquo;s how they break down by generation. For all employees, opportunities to learn and grow and the quality of their manager lead the list. But these issues are often more important for Millennials.</p><div><div><p> </p><div> </div></div></div><p>At their current stage in life, Millennials fundamentally think about their role as a stepping stone and a growth opportunity. But they also want to feel deeply committed to their role and to work for a manager who will invest in their development, which isn&rsquo;t entirely different from what other generations value. Our research shows that having a great manager and being part of a great management culture are important to all employees. However, Millennials place a greater emphasis on opportunities to learn and grow and opportunities for advancement.</p><p>What about ping-pong tables and free beer? Contrary to popular perception, Millennials place little importance on a company encouraging creativity or being a fun, informal place to work. In fact, Baby Boomers are slightly <em>more</em> likely than Millennials and Gen Xers to say that creativity and fun are &ldquo;extremely important&rdquo; to them when applying for a job. But Millennials do need to be convinced why and how an organization will help them learn, grow, and develop, and further their careers.</p><p>And although income is not among Millennials&rsquo; top five factors when applying for jobs, it still matters to them when looking for a job, as it does to all employees. Millennials have high levels of student debt and are living in an era of anemic wage growth. This might be why, as <a target=\"_blank\">we derived from a separate study</a>, half of Millennials said they would consider taking a job with another company for a raise of 20% or less. It is understandable that they would seek roles that make better use of their qualifications and increase their income. But companies should also know that Millennials sometimes value other job attributes, including learning and advancement, even more.</p><p>If your company wants to do a better job of retaining Millennials, it&rsquo;s important to understand what motivates them, what doesn&rsquo;t, and the delicate balance between the two. And while they differ in some ways from a recruiting and retention standpoint, Millennials largely want the same things from their employers as most generations. They look for growth opportunities, great managers, and jobs that are well-suited for their talents and interests. When organizations can provide these attributes, they may keep their Millennial employees from continually searching for &mdash; and pursuing &mdash; the next best thing elsewhere.</p></div></div><div> </div><p> </p>",

        "content": "<p><em>Caroline Ramade is general secretary of the incubator <a href=\"http://www.pionnieres.paris/en/\">Paris Pionni&egrave;res</a>, created in 2005 to help women entrepreneurs to launch their startup.</em></p><p> </p>        <p><strong>What is the history of Paris Pionni&egrave;res ?</strong></p><p>Paris Pionni&egrave;res was created 10 years ago to promote the presence of women in start-ups, because we found that there was less than 5% of women heads of start-ups.</p><p>At first it was an incubator. The goal was to support a woman as co-founder of an innovative project. So it was often mixed teams. Also, we begin support for women very early in the course of start-upper, at the stage of market research. We have given rise 200 start-ups in 10 years.</p><p>For our 10th anniversary, Paris became the capital of Europe for female start-uppers, with 21% of female heads of start-ups, for a global average of around 15%.</p><p>Paris is just behind the USA and Toronto. So it is very well positioned, there is a maturity of the French ecosystem.</p><p>The accompaniment is done in two stages, first with an acceleration program of 2 to 6 months, during which we validate the concept, this is a phase before creation. A stadium that does not exist in other incubators.</p><p>Then there is a validation committee, which allows candidates to go incubating for a year. The goal is to get into the eco-system. We passed from 30 to 60 start-ups incubated in this program. But the idea is that they can also go elsewhere. So we can send some candidates to other incubators.</p><p>64% of women said they did not feel able to become entrepreneurs. So we created a women start-up camp, the possible camp: 3 days to reveal the entrepreneur in yourself. A form of shock therapy, the goal is to be fast and to meet quickly the customer. There is also a training in entrepreneurial culture. The first pitch is made in front of a sympathetic jury. At this stage the participants just have an embryo idea. There are also role models, to know what it is to undertake.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How do you select projects?</strong></p><p>We have an online form, rather simple, we have more than 60 applications per month. We check whether the model is innovative, what is the course of the person &hellip; Here we select about 10 per month. But then we have 4 large selection days per year, with a jury of alumni, who listen to projects. We insist a lot on personality, but also on the nature of the project, and the innovation.</p><p>So the average ratio is about 15 selected by committees, so about 5 for 60.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is your business model?</strong></p><p>We are an association, so we do not take part in start-ups capital. For example possible camp is 300 euros for three days.</p><p>In what concerns the incubation, candidates are eligible for a grant that funds the accompaniment, which is provided by the city of Paris and the Public Investment Bank. And we take a share of the grant. But we also have our own subsidies.</p><p>We also have sponsors. We also have a project of intrapreneurship. In partnership with Pie by Five. An open innovation agency. A program named 66 miles, for 30 female managers from large groups. We help them to produce an intrapreneurship project.</p><p>The objective is the retention of female talents. It is a challenge to retain women but also find them. So far the intrapreneurship programs are not approached by women. it is difficult if there is no free time. So they do not go because they know they can not combine everything: the job in the company, the start-up project and the family life. Basically, with this 5-month program, it obliges the company to release one day a week for this entrepreneurial project. So many big companies are interested, including Airbus.</p><p>The female intrapreneurship represents 9 billion GDP and more. The idea is to get new leaders, people who will bring new ideas, new business. It brings value because it raises women in innovation.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What drives a female entrepreneur to go to Paris pionni&egrave;res rather than a normal incubator?</strong></p><p>In fact it is a mixed incubator, there are 50% men. It is actually the only incubator of Paris where there are so many women. In other conventional incubators there is 5% of women. We are the place of diversity, not of self-segregation. The only stuff which is only for women are the Possible Camp and 66 miles. When we welcome new start-ups incubated we just check that the woman is in lead position. We also have a modern communication, we insist on the notion of empowerment, rather than victimization.</p><p>Some women said they were afraid to go to conventional trampolines because there were only men. But we are not at all in an identitarian dynamic. It simply gives them power, if there is to pitch for example, it is women who pitch.</p><p>We especially set a fun atmosphere, with tipsy pitch, where you have to drink whenever you pitch. There is an optimistic spirit. There are men in the incubator, so they do not have the impression of self-segregation. Everything is mixed.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is now the relationship between female empowerment and feminism, is there a transformation of the concept of feminism?</strong></p><p>I place myself in the perspective of empowerment. It must become concrete. We have to reposition and think of the benefits all sides would have to move towards a change in society. Basically, there is a part of feminism, but not a feminism that excludes men. We will not be alone, we will be together. There is also Happy Men, a network of men who want less meetings late at night to see their children for example.</p><p>We must give back the power to act for women. We must therefore restore the entrepreneurial culture for women, we must educate, demonstrate examples. Children who have had their mother become entrepreneurs will have a good model. That&rsquo;s what produces changes.</p><p>For example, maternity leave is a tremendous opportunity to make an innovation project. It is a time to reflect. You move away from the company, and come back with lots of ideas.</p><p>Men don&rsquo;t have that, then that&rsquo;s a luxury to retire and take care of something else for 6 months. If men realized the benefit it represents, if it is authorized by society, men would be happier, because they never stop. They have a cult of performance which can cause a syndrome of imposture. This is the view of modern feminism. Get rid of the dialectic of the struggle.</p><p>When you make a retirement survey, men say that what they have lacked most is their family. Female start-uppers will bring a new leadership model. We will not deny the fact of caring for children.</p><p>But the problem is that women rarely show solidarity between them, because the successful woman reproduces the model of the killer, thinking that a woman can succeed only after pain and sacrifice. It&rsquo;s rare to succeed, successful women have drooled. They know only this model so they think it&rsquo;s the one we need.</p><p>But there is a new mindset that will revolutionize the canvas, and a new benevolence will also revolutionize solidarity between women and men.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Are there improvements? Are attitudes changing? What additional measures could be put in place?</strong></p><p>Attitudes are changing, because many young women come into our incubator directly after graduation. They have self-confidence and expertise. This generation will not wait until the last one, they will really go. It is also the role of companies to understand the added value that women represent, and think of ways to retain women in the company. A law will soon be passed to impose 40% of women on boards of directors. So it is urgent to identify those future administrators. We must find the women of power.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What are the differences between France and other countries on this subject?</strong></p><p>France is rather late. The US has done studies to show the benefits of having a woman in the board. It is still complicated, but the government has a limit. We can encourage things by law, but not everything. It also requires that companies act.</p><p>Today we also have crazy schedules. We work a lot. It is unsuited to family life. We must develop the company nurseries for example. So the state can develop education, but companies must allow time for parents.</p><p>Women&rsquo;s networks should be increased for concrete actions, not only do events and communication.</p>",

        "content": "<p><em>Doctor of Laws, Cristina Lunghi created in 1995 Arborus association specialized in issues of professional equality and equal opportunities. Expert at the European Commission on these issues for 15 years, she has written books including&laquo; Et si les femmes r&eacute;inventaient le travail &raquo; Ed 2001 d&rsquo;Organisation.&laquo; L&rsquo;&eacute;galit&eacute; professionnelle en pratique &raquo; Ed Eyrolles 2001 -. 2002&laquo; Bleu, Blanc, Rose, les femmes et la politique &raquo; First Ed, 2006.</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>What led you to work on equality issues?</strong></p><p>I am a lawyer, I have a PhD in European law. As part of my first mission in connection with the European Commission, I was full of rather conceptual ideas on equality; I had never heard that there were differences of treatment between women and men. Then I realized that France was second last in Europe on equal treatment. Italy, my second country, was before. So we have misrepresentations.</p><p>In 1995, I created Arborus, an association for the promotion of women in decision making. At the time I wrote to Martine Auriac, deputy mayor. She was very interested, and we finally organized a major international show in 1996, I was 28 years old. I had invited the embassies, the great female associative networks and large groups. It propelled me into public life quickly. I had a right to speak everywhere. I worked a lot in the political sphere, with all departments.</p><p>In 2003, Nicole Ameline took the ministry of women&rsquo;s rights. She organized meetings, face-to-face with network heads. I told her to create a label, so we created an equality label, the AFNOR label. Also labeled companies wanted to create a club in relationship to this label. So we did a lot of studies and benchmarks together. Especially, this was to create a common culture.</p><p>8 years ago, several companies like General Electric wanted an international label, so we created GEEIS, a tool for an international method and reporting.</p><p>I now have clubs in lots of countries. In France, now in Egypt, under the joint chairmanship of PresidentsHolland and Al-Sissi. Also in the US, I federated companies. The authorities said they would like me to experiment a particular method, so I created a structure dedicated to equality, to support companies in the implementation of equality.</p><p>Finally, our label is to become the assessment tool for the UN</p><p> </p><p><strong>What is glass ceiling?</strong></p><p>This is the time when it blocks. There are several types of ceilings that prevent go to higher grades. In some sectors, as a woman, you know you can never go into management committees. So we need to identify these sectors. The glass ceiling is determined by vocational courses.</p><p>Many surveys I made show that women&rsquo;s role model is a big obstacle. Mother role model, which has to look after her children.</p><p>Behind it, there is an ideology that says to women &ldquo;you can do anything.&rdquo; But it&rsquo;s not true, and it only creates frustration. Men do not fit in parenting because they know that this is not possible. We know we have to choose, you cannot devote yourself to your family and your job entirely, at high level.</p><p>For example, a global study was launched on parenting, to understand how it works in all countries of the world. I think the countries of the South will bring innovative ideas.</p><p>There is a blocking mentality that comes from the system, which operates on the basis of male behavioral systems and values : Presenteeism, comradship. Women behave differently. To succeed you have to adapt to these behavior patterns there, and to cut from your womanhood. And it changes not that much with new generations.</p><p>If you want to be in position of authority as a woman, you can not because the system doesn&rsquo;t allow it. Sometimes there are significant pools of women, but only some sectors.</p><p>Beyond networks, for ewample a TV channel said there were not enough women experts to invite. Because these women experts say that these TV or radio shows are too early, because they have to take care of their children. Men do not hesitate a second to go to a TV show, even if they are not competent.</p><p>There is a French movement that speaks of universalism, which says that men and women are the same. But it creates a systemic unequal treatment.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What are the ways to change those cultural barriers?</strong></p><p>Education from infancy to equality issues and exemplary. Create role model. Men with babies, who are in favour of equality. It should be visible. As a business leader, I can see that if you do not work very hard not you cannot get there.</p><p>What is not fair is that we focus on early childhood, but when they are older, teenagers for example, they need to be addressed too. A teenager who never sees his parents may have the rejection of working women. So there is a higher stress as a woman, when you come home, even when tired you don&rsquo;t have the right to say it.</p><p>Moreover, there is a new trend of reaction : as there is much talk of equality, some men say they are tired of equality.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t you think equality also needs a change in the social role of men?</strong></p><p>The system today is made for the same people profile. Men&rsquo;s careers are linear. While among women it is by stairs. But if you have an unsteady career you have a lower salary.</p><p>So, it must be said that everyone can organize stairs, men also.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Do you think the movement of fragmentation of the workplace, with freelancers and start-upers, could encourage this movement?</strong></p><p>One might think so, but everyone works hard. In the co-working spaces, you have either 25-30 years or over 50 years. So people who have no children.</p><p>I have started businesses, telling myself I could take care of my daughter. But you still have more work as a business owner than as an employee. So I decided to work at home, but I was always in my office. If you want to dedicate to a cause, you cannot fully take care of your family life elsewhere.</p><p>But you can take breaks. You can put a boost for two years, then spot a while. But the work / life balance is not possible. When working at a high level you must be completely available. But the solution is to take turns with spouse.</p><p>Those who succeed are those who manage to keep the same partner, because it gives stability, it allows one to grow while the other takes care of more children, and vice versa.</p><p>But for 80% of families it is women who care for kids. Same for divorces, it is always women who have children. And even for alternating guards, it is the mother who is responsible.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How is France compared to other countries on these issues?</strong></p><p>It&rsquo;s very paradoxical. France is specific because it gives the image of a modern country, seems revolutionary, but when looking at the statistics it&rsquo;s pathetic. We make statements and then we don&rsquo;t apply.</p><p>In terms of attitudes, France is quite late. By men, there is also sexism in France. In Italy, when I had a child I was congratulated. In France when I had a child everyone was negative&hellip;</p><p>But the Latin countries have a real will. They understood that women were elements of performance. They have fewer young, so betting on all youth elements.</p><p>In Italy, there is no problem to say that women bring something special and different to society, in France it is consedered as differentialism to say it.</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard in France to say that women are sources of wealth. At same time, it is said that there are no differences between men and women, and on the other hand differentiating laws and quotas are set.</p><p>I&rsquo;m worried today, because equality is questioned. There is a resurgence of traditionalism. Also with radical Islam</p><p> </p><p><strong>Also do you have reasons for hope?</strong></p><p>Yes, there are many initiatives, our labels are developing. Egyptian President asked us a mission, the same in Morocco&hellip; So it develops anyway.</p><p>But the perverse effect is that we have regress. Women or men who say they are tired of equality issues.</p><p>All this must be managed and anticipated. We must find new solutions &hellip; We would like to go faster, to propose systemic changes.</p><p>Nicole Ameline politically promotes this project on the Mediterranean area, and I do the same on the corporate side. And it is with this pair we will be able to do something.</p><p>The political sphere is still a motor, we must not destroy this system as we have not proposed anything else.</p><p>The institutions are very important. The State works, but it must adapt, to resume its sovereign functions. We need a state. But we also lack true intellectuals.</p><p>If we do not put on women, we will crash, as a country you have to walk on two legs. All countries that are in a bad state have a problem with equality.</p>",

Now a consultant in strategy, marketing and communication, I bring the &ldquo;sparkle&rdquo; to the most austere messages and accompany emerging ideas to help them find their market. I work on with leaders to realize their strategic vision and share it in the company.&rdquo;</em></p><p>Against &ldquo;talent drain&rdquo;, consulting companies deploy large resources. The consulting sector remains a valuable option for many young graduates. The hardest, for companies, is more to keep them than to recruit them. With a turnover of around 20%, consulting companies are condemned to innovate to retain young consultants who, after a few years, would be tempted by other ways such as entrepreneurship.</p><p> </p><p>October 25, 2016</p><p>The consulting world would register a certain disaffection on the part of young people. Major international consulting groups, even with their ingenuity, multiply the opportunities to attract young graduates. But they have found that the younger generation is focusing on other career paths. Is it a temporary aberration or a trend that will require a rebuilding to encourage the integration of young recruits? The favored businesses by students has been the same for years: the large consulting firms usually take first place, followed by tech companies like Google and Apple for graduates of business schools. This is a winning combination of the company&rsquo;s reputation and the overlap between the consumer brand and the employer brand. An innovative, dynamic company whose products or services are part of the youth&rsquo;s newspaper are going to be ahead of those whose reputation affects only the professional sphere. To attract the best, companies need to engage in a long seduction course, dotted with pitfalls and contradictions. Business schools have all developed entrepreneurship courses to meet an expectation that piques the interest of young people as they enter professional life.</p><p>Freedom Young people see their elders struggle to keep their jobs, clinging to a business model that fails to reinvent itself. From this, they design a fierce need for freedom. They want change if their hobbies don&rsquo;t meet their expectations, if their work environment is not filling, if work relationships become confrontational, if the desire is not there. They work project-by-project and not necessarily continuously. But they question their investment for each new project, even consider quitting if the project does not suit them.</p><p>In the absence of freedom, consulting firms have the advantage of engaging a variety of missions, customers, and goals&ndash; provided they push the young consultants into too large of projects.<br /> The report time In addition to their attachment to their freedom is young people&rsquo;s relationship to time; they are under the influence of immediate gratification caused by digital.</p><p>The young start-ups are expanding in the media, their founders have been able to find their ideal markets in record time.</p><p>The young consultant must be able to continuously measure its progress and see the realization in the most demanding tasks entrusted to it.<br /> The authority being an entrepreneur is a way to be free and to resolve the delicate problem of authority. Companies need to create conditions that develop the skills and the autonomy of its young employees. Management must be participatory and relational than directive and organizational. &rarr; In the council, the young consultant is in the crossfire of two authorities: that of the client and that of his manager. He expects confidence and consistency in their choices and decisions.<br /> The search for meaning The economic crisis and the threats to security encourage young people to find meaning in their commitments. They expect the same of their work and the company. They attach importance to the accuracy of the values employer brands and want their work to be a source of balance, fulfillment and meaning. Their motive is not to increase profit like their bosses.</p><p> </p><p>Community spirit The hyper youth connection to the world, virtual or real, connects to multiple communities. They need to belong to a group where they recognize, with which they share. They will value companies that can claim the label Great place to work (in 2016 where Google ranks 1st for 7 years), which are open to the working atmosphere in the proposed environment for relaxation moments when they can gather with peers. Their community instinct encourages them to share their questions, which can also be a point of attention for very sensitive to the confidentiality of data businesses. They are prepared to adhere to corporate values as if they are actually embodied. The working atmosphere of the giants of the Silicon Valley dream: Alternating work of the standing, sitting, restriction or prohibition of emails to promote exchanges, relaxation areas, support for the initiative. Even if they do not have the risk appetite of the entrepreneur, they are still titillated by the desire to innovate, create and are tuned companies that encourage them to be creative in their perimeters.</p><p>Opportunities to consolidate the young consultants in consulting firms should be frequent, to maintain community spirit or promotion. It is part of the decisive advantages of choice for large consulting firms, it must be preserved permanently, with or without missions. The identity Community spirit gum not provided individual qualities. The young staff intends to be recognized for its specific contribution not only for its freshness and specifically young enthusiasm. It stands by his peers, but it is unique. He expects a tailored management to make rapid progress. The company&rsquo;s size is an advantage for career development, but it should not overshadow the individual consideration. This focus on his own abilities does not prevent the young staff to enhance teamwork and versatility, flexible. Again to feel recognized but free. &rarr; The cast on missions in consulting is an opportunity to bring recognition to individuals by developing their role within a team.</p><p>All these criteria are not irreconcilable with the board, they are compatible provided some adjustments in the organization and management. And even for those who are animated by the spirit of entrepreneurship, what better way to challenger his entrepreneurial skills that accompany multiple and diverse case of business challenges with customers? The only criterion that still seems to resistance is that of the look. Piercings, tattoos and thongs must remain hidden.</p>",

        "content": "<p>MARCH 23, 2016 &mdash; Julie Morgenstern &mdash; HBR</p><p>Tara was a talented senior editor known for her innovative ideas and quality work. Recently, however, she&rsquo;d become the team bottleneck: Tasks went into her office and never came out.</p><div><div><p>After three warnings she was put on probation. Stumped, her boss called me in to see if I could help. Tara appeared to be working very hard, eating lunch at her desk and staying late. But whenever she was asked about the status of any project, all she could ever say was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m working on it.&rdquo;</p><p>Tara&rsquo;s delays routinely brought the department to a standstill, sapping productivity and morale. Her colleagues never knew when they were going to get things from her, making it impossible for them to effectively organize their own workdays. Everyone was weary of canceling evening plans and working weekends to compensate for Tara&rsquo;s unpredictable output.</p><p>In our first coaching session, Tara told me her workload had swelled to massive proportions when the company shifted its market strategy and technology. In the face of too much to do and not enough time to do it, Tara&rsquo;s anxiety skyrocketed. She calmed herself by working on each project <em>a little</em>. Incremental progress on each task made Tara feel &ldquo;in control.&rdquo; Of course, that very strategy was a disaster for her colleagues.</p><p>Bottlenecking puts your career and reputation at risk and takes a significant emotional toll. Here are four root causes of it &mdash; and solutions for each:</p><h3><strong>Plate-spinning</strong></h3><p>This scattered, shallow approach to managing multiple projects derailed Tara. Feeling overwhelmed or simply being disorganized can make it hard to feel confident that whatever you are working on at that moment is indeed the most important thing.</p><p>To get out of plate-spinning mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Ask your boss to help set priorities. </strong>Most bosses prefer that you come to them for guidance, and will willingly give it to you. Priorities can often be shuffled. You just have to ask.</li><li><strong>Organize your time and your tasks</strong>. Tara needed to allocate her time between generating ideas, editing, developing relationships with freelancers, and supporting her direct reports. To become more effective, she organized her to-do list by those categories so she could quickly spot the most important task in each and then work in calendar blocks assigned to each category. As work came in, she acknowledged receipt and let people know when to expect a response.</li><li><strong>Treat each day like a resume<em>.</em></strong> Effective resumes list accomplishments, not activities. Similarly, decide in advance on your deliverables for the day and stick to the plan. Create a daily report of what you completed to close the loop. After Tara started tracking her time and accomplishments each day, she was successfully able to make the case to her boss to hire an assistant editor.</li></ul><h3><strong>People-pleasing</strong></h3><p>Sometimes we struggle to say no because we see our own value in terms of our accessibility rather than in terms of our ability to solve problems. Saying yes to quick wins can also compensate for feeling unable to get the important work done.</p><p>To get out of people-pleasing mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Get clear on what you&rsquo;re being paid to produce.</strong> Whether you&rsquo;re paid to supervise, share knowledge, or create things, you have a job to do. Most of your time should be spent on your core job and existing commitments. Cull the rest ruthlessly.</li><li><strong>Set aside an overflow block. </strong>Some unexpected requests are part of the job and are truly important, but most aren&rsquo;t urgent, important, or even relevant to our work. Still, you want to be a good citizen and build your work relationships. Reserve a daily or weekly block to tackle last-minute requests. By limiting the time you can spend on them, you will develop better criteria for deciding what to take on.</li><li><strong>Develop the art of the elegant no</strong>. If an incoming request isn&rsquo;t the best use of your time, talk about it objectively. You&rsquo;re not busy doing &ldquo;your work&rdquo; or &ldquo;this person&rsquo;s work&rdquo; &mdash; you are all doing the company&rsquo;s work. Prepare a script: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m flattered you thought of me for this. But the company/my boss/the client is counting on me to focus my attention on Y. I couldn&rsquo;t do your task justice right now. Here is a guide/FAQ that might help.&rdquo;</li></ul><div> </div><h3><strong>Perfectionism</strong></h3><p>Perfectionists spend more time than necessary on projects, struggling to complete things. To them, work is either brilliant or horrible and every decision is equally important, from the menu for a board meeting to the decision to fire someone.</p><p>To avoid the perfectionism trap, you need to:</p><ul><li><strong>Create simple policies for decisions you make regularly. </strong>Decisions take a cognitive toll; preserve your decision making for issues that are worth brainpower, and create policies for the rest. For example, limit internal memos to two revision rounds, and set objective criteria for quickly filtering sales leads.</li><li><strong>Determine the MAX-MIN-MOD before you start<em>.</em></strong> Define three concrete levels of performance for large tasks: the maximum, minimum, and moderate contribution you can make, with specific steps and a time estimate. You&rsquo;ll be better able to choose the appropriate level of engagement given the stakes and everything else on your plate.</li><li><strong>Partner with a finisher. </strong>Pair with a colleague with a complementary skill set. If you&rsquo;re writing something, find a good editor. Some of my clients carve out a decision hour for the boring, tedious stuff, using an assistant as a sounding board.</li></ul><h3><strong>Processing intuitively</strong></h3><p>&ldquo;Intuitive doers&rdquo; operate by feel, knowing what &ldquo;good&rdquo; looks like when they see it but struggling to describe it to others when delegating. Talented ones are promoted to managerial roles, where they flounder because they can&rsquo;t handle the scale they&rsquo;ve grown into.</p><p>To get out of intuitive processing mode:</p><ul><li><strong>Identify the building blocks of your process</strong>. Delegation begins by figuring out exactly what you can delegate. Break your work into clear stages&shy; and hand the heavy lifting to others. Devote your time to where you can best make your unique contribution.</li><li><strong>Provide guidance. </strong>Spend time up front to clearly articulate what you instinctively do. Ask yourself: &ldquo;When this comes back, what will I be looking for?&rdquo; Communicate those criteria to the team.</li><li><strong>Don&rsquo;t do other people&rsquo;s jobs. </strong>Build in checkpoints to evaluate progress, ensure that things are on track, and correct course if necessary &mdash; but let people do their own work.</li></ul><p>Completing tasks and achieving goals energizes everyone on the team. In my years as a productivity coach, I&rsquo;ve found that nothing solves the dilemma more effectively and conclusively than a quick and thorough diagnosis and application of these principles. Take action now and you&rsquo;ll be amazed at the momentum you can achieve.</p></div></div><div> </div>",

        "content": "<p>NOVEMBER 19, 2015 &mdash; Amy Gallo &mdash; HBR</p><div>Ask anyone who travels for work: It&rsquo;s not as glamorous as it looks. Yes, sometimes you get to explore new places, meet interesting people, and rack up frequent flyer miles for future vacations. But you&rsquo;re also yanked out of your regular, comfortable routine, spend too much time standing in airport security lines, and you&rsquo;re miles away from people who know you well. The excitement can wear off easily&mdash;and many business travelers are left feeling lonely.</div><div><div><p>A <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.surrey.ac.uk%2Fshtm%2FFiles%2FCohen%2520and%2520Gossling%25202015%2520EPA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2015 study</a> finds there are a host of costs&mdash;physiological, psychological and emotional, and social&mdash;to frequent travel. The study authors call this the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/gulliver/2015/08/frequent-flyers\" target=\"_blank\">darker side of hypermobility</a>.&rdquo; In one <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/48433282\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> of 1,001 business travelers, half the respondents said the most stressful part of being away is missing family. Not only is travel hard on the person getting on the plane, other <a>research</a> shows it&rsquo;s tough on any spouses or family left back home.</p><p>To help those travelers who feel lonely when they&rsquo;re on the road, I&rsquo;ve drawn on my own experience (both in my current gig and in my previous life as a management consultant) as well as the advice of friends and colleagues, including consultants, engineers, media managers, and entrepreneurs, who are regularly away from home.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t work in your room</strong>. It&rsquo;s tempting to stay squirreled up in your hotel room in your pajamas, but it&rsquo;s better to get out if you can. If your hotel doesn&rsquo;t offer co-working space like <a href=\"http://skift.com/2015/10/09/viennas-new-on-demand-coworking-hotel-is-the-future-of-hospitality/\" target=\"_blank\">this one in Vienna</a>, park yourself in the hotel lobby or find a nearby coffee shop (Yelp can help you find something workable). If you need a quiet place to work and a public space won&rsquo;t do, invite a colleague who&rsquo;s on the trip to work in your room with you. At least you&rsquo;ll have someone to chat with when you take a break.</p><p><strong>Steal small moments to stay in touch with people back home</strong>. Business trips can feel harried and rushed. And with time-zone differences, it can be tough to coordinate calls home. Marketing consultant Dorie Clark, who travels 50% of her time, says that she <a href=\"https://www.evernote.com/OutboundRedirect.action?dest=https%3A%2F%2Fhbr.org%2F2015%2F11%2Fhow-to-use-your-travel-time-productively\" target=\"_blank\">makes quick calls to friends</a> while she&rsquo;s in transit from one place to the next. She has their numbers teed up on her favorites list and either leaves a message or has a quick 15-minute chat. You can also use texts or pictures to stay connected. Tom Gardos, an engineer who makes several international trips each year, says that on his last overseas stay, his eight-year-old daughter gave him a little plastic animal to take with him. &ldquo;She said it was to keep me company. I ended up taking pictures of it with different landmarks in the background and emailing them home. And of course it reminded me of her each time I did it,&rdquo; he says. Lisa Schneider, who travels between her media company&rsquo;s multiple offices, suggests a two-person traveling book club. &ldquo;Commit to reading the same thing as a friend&mdash;an article or a book&shy;&mdash;and then talk about it while you&rsquo;re away or when you get home.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Skype or FaceTime</strong>. This is an obvious one but seeing your loved ones faces, even for brief moments, is a huge help. I never really liked the pressure of having a quick catch-up call &mdash; &ldquo;How was your day at school?&rdquo; &ldquo;How&rsquo;d the meeting go?&rdquo; &ldquo;Did you get your homework done?&rdquo; &mdash; so my husband sometimes just leaves his computer on the dining room table as he and our daughter go about their evening. They might chat with me as they walk by, or while they&rsquo;re eating dinner, but often I just watch my daughter practicing her piano, my dog wandering around the house. On one trip where I didn&rsquo;t return to my hotel room until after my daughter was already in bed, I had my husband put his computer on my daughter&rsquo;s bedside table so I could watch her sleep for a little while. And that was all I needed to get me through the night.</p><p><strong>Sightsee</strong>. With a packed agenda, it&rsquo;s often tough to make time to enjoy the city. Don&rsquo;t stress yourself out if you can&rsquo;t get out to every tourist destination. If you do have some windows of time, keep it manageable. Clark suggests you pick out one or two things. When she was in Pittsburgh, she made a point of visiting the Andy Warhol Museum and booking a trip to Frank Lloyd Wright&rsquo;s Falling Water. &ldquo;It helps to distract yourself and feel like you&rsquo;re having a cool experience and it&rsquo;s not just one hotel room after another,&rdquo; she says. She admits that it might be more fun to do these activities with someone else, &ldquo;but seeing them solo is a lot more interesting than feeling like your life is a conveyer belt, doing the same thing eternally in different places. Enjoying what&rsquo;s unique about the places I visit helps me realize there&rsquo;s value in the travel I do, even if it can sometimes feel tiring or frustrating.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Bring someone along</strong>. Many of the people I talked to said they are often too tired from traveling to make the extra effort of meeting up with friends or navigating a city they don&rsquo;t know that well. So some bring a companion on their trip&mdash;a spouse, a teenage child, or a friend. Cary L. Cooper, a professor of organizational psychology and health at Lancaster University Management School, brings his wife with him on his business trips when he can. As he says in this <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/18/uk-business-travel-stress-idUSLNE89H01Q20121018#V12FM20tfpKJ2kh4.99\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters article</a>, it not only lessens loneliness, it can also make you work smarter. &ldquo;If the person feels more relaxed, can unwind quicker, can get over the jet-lag better, they will perform better.&rdquo;</p><p>I have an old friend who lives on the West Coast and travels regularly for work. I don&rsquo;t get to see her often because we live so far away and our lives are busy. So when she spends a few days in a different city, I&rsquo;ll often join her. I typically work from a nearby caf&eacute; while she is off at her meetings. She loves coming back to the room to a friendly face, I love the mini-vacation (with a free hotel room!). We&rsquo;ll often try to schedule the trip over a weekend so we can explore the city or do some sightseeing, things she&rsquo;s often too tired to do during the workweek.</p><p><strong>Consider sharing your hotel room with a colleague</strong>. Stick with me for a moment. I&rsquo;m an introvert. I like my privacy. And one of the best things about going away on a trip is being left alone to do what I want (and watch what TV I want) in a hotel room. But years ago, when I was assigned to a project in Washington D.C., my colleague and I went to book our rooms and realized that the hotel only had one room left. We could&rsquo;ve stayed elsewhere but we had an early client meeting in the hotel the next morning. She suggested we share the room. I thought she was crazy, but I figured it was only one night.</p><p>Yes, negotiating who got to take a shower first was awkward but we waded our way through that and ended up staying up late talking, discovering we had lots in common. I found out she edited a book I had just read. We realized we knew many of the same people. It was comforting to talk with someone about books and movies and yes, even work, as I fell asleep. And when we returned to DC the following week, we booked a room together again. She&rsquo;s become a life-long friend, something that may not have happened had we just sat across a meeting table from one another.</p><div> </div><p>Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to share a room with someone for this to happen. Invite your colleague to dinner and suggest you don&rsquo;t talk about work. Discover something you both like to do (Bowling? Going to book stores?) and take the time to do that in the city you&rsquo;re visiting.</p><p><strong>Enjoy your alone time</strong>. Entrepreneur and consultant Deb Mills-Scofield says that one of the things that makes the road less lonely for her is appreciating the solitude. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find it lonely and I don&rsquo;t mean that I don&rsquo;t love my family but it does give me alone time, which is so rare.&rdquo; Engineer Tom Gardos agrees: &ldquo;My attitude has changed now that I have two kids. Now I like the down time at night when I travel.&rdquo; So instead of pining for what you&rsquo;re missing at home, enjoy the quiet of your room, read a book, watch a movie, or just get to bed early.</p><p>Business travel may be tough at times but it certainly isn&rsquo;t all bad. In the <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/48433282\" target=\"_blank\">survey I mentioned earlier</a>, most respondents felt that traveling for work helped their career and many felt positive when thinking about an upcoming trip. But for those times where you get down, know that there are things you can do&mdash;things that often don&rsquo;t take a lot of time or extra effort&mdash;to lessen the loneliness.</p></div><div> </div></div>",

She tells us about the evolution of the atractiveness of consulting companies toward youth.</em></p><p> </p><p>November 1, 2016 &mdash; Jeweliet Tangen &amp; Adrien Cools &mdash; Editorial Team</p><p> </p><p><strong>What was your career? </strong></p><p>I have fifteen years of HR experience, mainly in the council. I also had the opportunity to work in IT. AT Kearney had invested in the Internet bubble, he belonged to EDF&hellip; That&rsquo;s when I became interested in it. And I ended up in strategy consulting. Eventually I came back to headquarters, specializing in everything concerning talent management, high potentials and careers</p><p>Then I joined a start-up in Lyon that specialized in IT consulting and software development. They created a tool to help public and private decision making of territorial foresight. I stayed for 6 months, then I left for other competing projects issues. I also work for Channel in a management position to address several HR issues; Talent management, HR organizational audit, HR people review.</p><p> </p><p><strong>There is a disaffection for the board. As HR, have you seen this disaffection, how is it translated?</strong></p><p>It has been rather progressive in recent years, in fact, there has been quite a turn. Initially, markets would split the firms for the best, then others were moving toward organizational firms. As far as business goes, businesses and customers have changed significantly from the years 1990-2000. We have seen an increase of internal consultants. It&rsquo;s super classic today, such as internal policy directions. There have been more and more seniors going into the industry as internal consultants. Companies have gained agility, learned, and began to recruit consultants for themselves. The profession has evolved in addition to the governing of firms. Firms have disappeared, others have merged, this all has created fewer players. I personally saw that the HR strategy had completely changed and you now had to be much more competitive</p><p>Big scandals began to effect the reputation of the trade. The consultants were beginning to question in relation to this business. The recruitment of experienced individuals is a challenge for law today. I find that this is because a manager does not leave for another company unless they&rsquo;re facing serious issues at their current companies. Needless to say, the recruitment process has become quite complicated. For juniors, however, there is a different reflection in the recruitment process. Is this related to the generation Y or Z? I do not know. Is it a different relationship work? No doubt these are fundamental questions.</p><p> </p><p><strong>There have been many ideas about millennials. Often it is said that they are more creative. What are your thoughts on the characteristics of millennials? </strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m pretty cautious with respect to that. Creativity, is that implying that young people are more creative? This is not particularly related to millennials, I think. Perhaps the person is more alert, and then may be more curious or key to everything.</p><p>There is also an ability to bounce back, less fear. Additionally, millennials do not feel a sense of obligation from by having paid, stable job. That is something that comes from the older generations. Previously, we had more seniors who were leaving for a matter of mobility, to balance life / work, or a new opportunity. But these last years, the turnover rate is most apparent in younger workers. Consultant juniors resigned after a year or two for sabbaticals, to think, or to do something else. The desire for entrepreneurship is also greatly higher in these young workers.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Today, there is a new trend in management. Is conventional industries and consulting firms taking action to follow these trends? </strong></p><p>There is a lot of resistance to that in France. Especially in conventional businesses&mdash;that is, except with startups and tech companies, where it has become a trademark.<br /> I think these new ways of working is a necessity. Pragmatically, this is how the organizations are integrating? And it has nothing to do with the new generations. It would be useless and anti-productive to continue having stratified organizations. But the application is complicated. At Channel this was a non-issue. Today it&rsquo;s less issues between management and the workers, but there is still a hierarchy. It is not easy to challenge. This is surely the less simple construction.</p><p> </p><p><strong>You have observed the aspirations of youth toward entrepreneurship. To help attract these young people, is entrepreneurship a solution? Is this considered by the consulting firms? </strong></p><p>Yes it is a solution. In consulting the alumni network is such that there is some real firepower, which can enable a startup to boot. It is an argument that works. Make some media on the business model, with internal resources, it works pretty well. It can be a differentiating argument. Some firms do of successful way, with aid. I have not seen any specific resistances.</p>",

Employees can no longer satisfy themselves of large traditional companies, because ultimately the human factor and personal development is not so important to them. People know that “classic groups” are hiring people to do a specific job, and that for any good or bad reason, (when the job is achieved or governance has changed) they can decide to fire someone without any problem. And they take someone else.</p><p>Things are starting to change, people have become aware of the reality of companies and have a desire for emancipation. Companies need a precise skill at a precise time, but individuals don’t want to do the same thing all the time, they want change! Innovation is so fast and with new technologies, everyone can have the opportunity to create his own business. This eco-system did not exist 10-15 years ago. Increasingly, first in the USA, but also in France, a big part of the experimented labor force now works as freelancers.</p><p></p><p><strong>Start-ups, you work with, do you think they are going to become the same large traditional companies or is there a real change of nature?</strong></p><p></p><p>No, the start-up spirit is a fundamental movement. Start-ups which became big companies like Google or Facebook, their mode remains one of the start-up, everything can move fast, no process is fixed. Companies operate in project mode, and hierarchy is less important, what matters are individuals who will work on the project. The principle of the Hackathon, for example, illustrates this idea; there is always a dynamic of independence and innovation at the heart of the company, which puts individuals at the center.</p><p>But this model aims to extend and generalize. Retailing, where I work, counts many large traditional companies, but they are very interested in the start-up model, and want to integrate this operating mode.</p><p>The rise of freelancers and start-ups is part of the same dynamic. This is to put individuals and their knowledge, experience at the center of the business.</p><p></p><p><strong>What balance do you find between work and private life?</strong></p><p>As a freelancer, it&#8217;s a real challenge because the two can mix easily. Even physically, because I work at home, but it&#8217;s also nice because I can work when I want, where I want depending on my customers’ priorities. But it is true that it is more difficult to put a border between work and private life. I allow myself time when I disconnect completely. But it&#8217;s a new rhythm I&#8217;m still learning.</p><p></p><p><strong>How do you think consulting is going to evolve?</strong></p><p>Consulting was born with individuals who have created cooperatives to jointly provide their services to companies, then these entities got structured in large machines, with processes and calibrated hierarchies.</p><p>But now, two major changes are observed. First of all, customers no longer ask the consultants to think or to manage project or perform tasks as employees (body shopping), but they have more practical needs related to digital with a higher added value, which require more specific expertise. Consulting firms must therefore appeal to other actors such as start-ups.</p><p>Then the individuals themselves sought independence and talented consultants, quite often, become freelancers. Consulting firms therefore have to seek these independents.</p><p>For consulting firms, it is even more difficult to recruit young people because they aspire to move, create their business and do not want to work in large companies.</p><p>Inevitably, the consulting profession is evolving. The question is whether the consulting firms will be able to adopt a new long-term vision and adapt to this change.</p><p>Even if the Brand of a consulting firm can still be a real value for its customers, new players appear, platforms for example, a new form of business consulting. By nature, these platforms represent a new desire for freedom and a new power of knowledge and competencies, which are shared. These actors are potential competitors for consulting firms.</p><p></p><p><strong>For young people who have less experience, is it possible to work directly as freelancers without beginning in a big company?</strong></p><p>I am working with a start-up that allows young people to carry out freelance assignments. Young people love to manage their time as they wish. Today it has entered the culture, and businesses use them regardless of skill level.</p><p>I feel that Freelance is a global aspiration, people do not want to get into boxes, they want to manage their time, they prefer to work in project mode, and it is also more comfortable from a financial point of view.</p><p>If you begin to work as freelancer or entrepreneur, you need to have big idea and motivation, or deep skills in what you want to do. This schema offers many opportunities to grow but also many occasion to fail. Failure has now to be considered as a part of the learning experience.</p><p></p><p><strong>Do you have any advice for someone who wants to work as a freelancer?</strong></p><p>Of course, I advise to DARE, as Obama’s moto says: yes we can! Trust in yourself! Your future is in your hands.</p><p>We all have special talents; everyone has to find out about what he is good at or what pleases him. Outside France, it is more fluid, young people travel after high school, to multiply experiences rather than go into a mold.</p><p>In France, there is currently a tension about the status of work, but it is not the majority. I’m convinced that most of people want more flexibility, more freedom, but due to politics and culture, they are still afraid. There is in France a real dynamic, many initiatives and opportunities. But we must also avoid the pitfall of self-censorship.</p>",

Chandler published The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business in which he argued that in the nineteenth century, Adam Smith&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;<em>invisible hand</em>&rdquo; of the market was replaced by the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Visible_Hand:_The_Managerial_Revolution_in_American_Business\"><em>visible hand</em></a>&rdquo; of middle management. The managers of America&rsquo;s gigantic corporations&mdash;General Electric among them &mdash;became a powerful institution and engine of the US economy.</p><p>As modern multi-unit business supplanted traditional family enterprise, administrative coordination and managerial hierarchy became a source of power and continued growth. These salaried managers became increasingly professional and thus, management was separated from ownership. That is how HR emerged as one of the most critical corporate functions. A part of middle management, HR managers were responsible for all the others. They would have to make human resources management into a well-oiled and reliable machine for the &ldquo;<em>visible hand</em>&rdquo; to work its magic.</p><p>Today, HR is increasingly criticized and challenged. It is said to have become irrelevant. As new forms of management are being created and companies are being &ldquo;liberated&rdquo;, many rungs in the hierarchy are to be destroyed. HR is to be transformed or even to disappear as a separate business unit.<br /> To understand <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management\">HR&rsquo;s evolution</a> and the challenges it is facing today, it is interesting to have a closer look at its birth and its rise. For what made HR so successful yesterday could be exactly what puts it under so much fire today. But in its past glory also lie the secrets to its continued future&hellip;</p><p> </p><p><strong>How HR came to be</strong><br /> Two men are generally credited with &ldquo;creating&rdquo; the idea of HR in the 18th century. The first, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Owen\">Robert Owen</a>, is a Scottish social reformer who thought workers ought to be &ldquo;motivated&rdquo; rather than threatened. The second, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage\">Charles Babbage</a>, was a mechanical engineer who brought the scientific approach to management (long before Frederick Taylor). Although there was no talk of &ldquo;HR&rdquo; during the industrial revolution, these two men can indeed be said to have contributed to the birth of HR as a discipline roughly a century later. They both understood that people were responsible for the success of an organisation and that their wellbeing led to better work.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only a century later that HR actually became a specific field, when <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Winslow_Taylor\">Frederick Taylor</a>, a mechanical engineer (like Babbage), explored &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_management\"><em>scientific management</em></a>&rdquo;, trying to increase the economic efficiency of manufacturing workers. He identified labour as the main input in the manufacturing process and dedicated his life to improving its productivity. Thus Taylor was probably the first &ldquo;management consultant&rdquo; in history, and the father of HR.</p><p>He believed all control ought to be transferred from workers to management, and set out to increase the separation between planning work (brain) and executing work (hands). Managers were to give plans and job specifications to the workers. For the organization to avoid arbitrariness, the relationships between managers and employees were to be quite impersonal. The idea was to prevent favoritism, nepotism and prejudice to promote rationality and efficiency.</p><p>As gigantic corporations and sprawling public administrations changed the business and public policy landscapes in the late 19th- early 20th centuries, the employer-employee relationship was deeply transformed. It is then that &ldquo;<em>industrial and labor relations</em>&rdquo; (the original name given to &ldquo;HR&rdquo;) became <a href=\"http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/management/Or-Pr/Pioneers-of-Management.html\">formalized as a discipline</a>. Then the work of several psychologists, sociologists and philosophers&mdash;such as Max Weber, Abraham Maslow or Kurt Lewin&mdash;completed the stock of human sciences knowledge that would make HR into an academic and scientific discipline to be taught at university (which happened in the late 1940s).</p><p>Throughout the following decades, modern HR would become increasingly professional and structured around five core functions&mdash;staffing, human resource development, compensation and benefits, safety and health, and employee and labor relations&mdash;and an increasingly long list of tasks. Within HR, more and more executives would become highly specialized and deal with one set of issues only. The organization of HR as a department would mirror corporate organization as a whole.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What could cause its downfall</strong><br /> It&rsquo;s become <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2012/01/stop-bashing-hr.html\">a little too commonplace</a> to predict the downfall of HR. Some claim its future will be radically different and others that it may altogether cease to exist as a separate corporate function. Many agree modern HR is being &ldquo;disrupted&rdquo; by digital, but digital isn&rsquo;t everything. Three types of transformations are generally listed:</p><p><strong>Technological</strong>: HR may continue to exist as a department, but it will incorporate more tech. HR can be made more efficient. <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3062995/mind-and-machine/how-ai-is-changing-human-resources\">Artificial intelligence can already</a> do a lot of HR tasks better. Will algorithms replace all HR executives? Software platforms have automated many tasks. The use of big data has led some companies to optimize what required intuition only, which is illustrated at length in the book <em><a href=\"https://www.workrules.net/\">Work Rules! </a>Insights from inside Google That Will Transform How You Live And Lead</em>, by Laszlo Bock, Senior Vice President of &ldquo;People Operations&rdquo; (HR) at Google, who writes <em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trust your gut: use data to predict and shape the future!&rdquo;</em></p><p>Many HR practices have already been transformed. The process of recruiting can never go back to what it was. Recruiters used to rely essentially on printing in publications and word of mouth to fill open positions. Now they have access to millions of possible recruits and rely increasingly on <a href=\"http://www.capterra.com/recruiting-software/\">e-recruiting tools </a>to handle the workload. HR professionals have to have a social media presence to build an employer brand. They can post jobs and track applicants for all the different positions on a single platform. Interview reviews, background and onboarding data is centralized. Many software solutions have been developed for recruiters. <a href=\"http://www.journaldunet.com/solutions/saas-logiciel/salesforce-for-hr-0415.shtml\">Salesforce</a>, for example, has become a key player on that market.</p><p>HR has to process a vast amount of paperwork and data on a daily basis. Human Resources Information Systems (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resource_management_system\">HRIS</a>) have made it possible for HR to streamline the process. Data can be analyzed quickly across many locations. Examples of such Human Resources Information Systems include PeopleSoft, MyTime, SAP, Timeco, and JobsNavigator.</p><p>Last but not least, training has also been made more efficient and cheaper. Training in virtual classrooms makes it possible for the HR professionals to train a large number of employees quickly and to assess their progress through computerized testing programs. Employees can take control of their own learning and development by engaging in training at a time and place of their choosing, helping them manage their work-life balance.</p><p>At best, technology automates many of the tasks that used to be performed by HR professionals. At worst, these professionals could be made redundant for those tasks. Like a lot of professions, HR can never be the same again. You can ignore tech.</p><p><strong>Organizational</strong>: as traditional hierarchical organizations are being challenged, so is traditional HR as a separate department. Netflix and other Silicon Valley giants have been showing the way towards new forms of organizations and HR. These companies believe culture trumps everything else when it comes to running human resources. They claim HR functions should not be separated from the rest of the company&rsquo;s operations, because, they say, only the teams themselves can know exactly who can be a &ldquo;cultural fit&rdquo;. So HR is to be organically integrated into the rest of the company. Recruiting, training and everything else is to be a side job for everyone who isn&rsquo;t HR.</p><p>Silicon Valley companies are also leading the charge when it comes to flattening organizational charts. In flat organizations, employees are more autonomous and responsible. There is supposedly no separation between the &ldquo;brain&rdquo; and the &ldquo;hands&rdquo; anymore. The whole notion of a separate HR department that decides how HR is to be run then becomes irrelevant. Likewise, in &ldquo;liberated&rdquo; companies&mdash;a concept made popular by Isaac Getz&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://freedomincbook.com/\"><em>Freedom Inc</em></a>.&mdash; the whole notion of HR becomes obsolete.<br /> Last but not least, organizations are transformed by the ever bigger role played by <a href=\"http://www.willbegroup.com/les-nouvelles-formes-de-travail-transforment-les-rh/\">workers who are outside</a> the organization. Some tasks are crowdsourced, others are outsourced. More freelancers do work that used to be controlled internally. If work is increasingly performed outside the organization, how does it affect HR?</p><p>Organizational transformations present an unprecedented challenge to HR professionals. But these changes do not necessarily make them redundant. If anything, their role is more important than ever! That role will be transformed&mdash;because you can&rsquo;t &ldquo;manage&rdquo; outsiders like you can manage your own people&mdash;and will focus increasingly on culture to cement all the different players together&hellip;</p><p><strong>Cultural</strong>: workers have new aspirations that lead them to work as independent workers or to seek increased flexibility in their jobs. The increasingly high number of freelancers in turn affects the aspirations and the culture of &ldquo;regular&rdquo; workers as well. HR professionals are therefore obsessed with the idea of &ldquo;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/06/23/know-your-millennial-co-workers/\"><em>understanding millennials</em></a>&rdquo;.</p><p>More importantly the role of culture in companies is becoming ever more critical. It is both the cement and the engine of an organization. For HR professionals, culture can either be an empty buzzword or the opportunity to reinvent their work.</p><p>Hiring cultural fits has never been more critical! <a href=\"http://www.willbegroup.com/en/les-ressources-humaines-en-transition-le-modele-netflix-gagne-du-terrain/\">Netflix&rsquo;s Patty McCord</a> said it all a few years ago:<br /> <em>&ldquo;Hire, Reward, and Tolerate Only Fully Formed Adults.</em><br /> <em> If you&rsquo;re careful to hire people who will put the company&rsquo;s interests first, who understand and support the desire for a high-performance workplace, 97% of your employees will do the right thing. Most companies spend endless time and money writing and enforcing HR policies to deal with problems the other 3% might cause. Instead, we tried really hard to not hire those people, and we let them go if it turned out we&rsquo;d made a hiring mistake.</em></p><p><em>Adult-like behavior means talking openly about issues with your boss, your colleagues, and your subordinates. It means recognizing that even in companies with reams of HR policies, those policies are frequently skirted as managers and their reports work out what makes sense on a case-by-case basis.&rdquo; (&ldquo;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2014/01/how-netflix-reinvented-hr\">How Netflix reinvented HR</a>&rdquo;)</em></p><p> </p><p>If, as Peter Drucker once said, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2011/03/culture-trumps-strategy-every\"><em>culture trumps strategy anytime</em></a>&rdquo;, then HR could be showing the way forward for everyone else!</p><p>When one looks at the early history of HR, one can see it was successful because it fit the strategy of the corporations of the time and shaped their culture and organizational model. These corporations are changing at a fast pace. More work is now automated or performed outside traditional organizations.<br /> HR is not doomed to disappear. It will have to find a new role in tomorrow&rsquo;s organizations. Its number one mission will be to their culture</p><p> </p>",

        "title": "Branding in the Age of Social Media",
        "content": "<p>MARCH 2016 &mdash; Douglas Holt &mdash; HBR<br /> In the era of Facebook and YouTube, brand building has become a vexing challenge. This is not how things were supposed to turn out. A decade ago most companies were heralding the arrival of a new golden age of branding. They hired creative agencies and armies of technologists to insert brands throughout the digital universe. Viral, buzz, memes, stickiness, and form factor became the lingua franca of branding. But despite all the hoopla, such efforts have had very little payoff.</p><p>As a central feature of their digital strategy, companies made huge bets on what is often called branded content. The thinking went like this: Social media would allow your company to leapfrog traditional media and forge relationships directly with customers. If you told them great stories and connected with them in real time, your brand would become a hub for a community of consumers. Businesses have invested billions pursuing this vision. Yet few brands have generated meaningful consumer interest online. In fact, social media seems to have made brands less significant. What has gone wrong?</p><p>To solve this puzzle, we need to remember that brands succeed when they break through in culture. And branding is a set of techniques designed to generate cultural relevance. Digital technologies have not only created potent new social networks but also dramatically altered how culture works. Digital crowds now serve as very effective and prolific innovators of culture&mdash;a phenomenon I call crowdculture. Crowdculture changes the rules of branding&mdash;which techniques work and which do not. If we understand crowdculture, then, we can figure out why branded-content strategies have fallen flat&mdash;and what alternative branding methods are empowered by social media.</p><h3>Why Branded Content and Sponsorships Used to Work</h3><p>While promoters insist that branded content is a hot new thing, it&rsquo;s actually a relic of the mass media age that has been repackaged as a digital concept. In the early days of that era, companies borrowed approaches from popular entertainment to make their brands famous, using short-form storytelling, cinematic tricks, songs, and empathetic characters to win over audiences. Classic ads like Alka-Seltzer&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Can&rsquo;t Believe I Ate the Whole Thing,&rdquo; Frito-Lay&rsquo;s &ldquo;Frito Bandito,&rdquo; and Farrah Fawcett &ldquo;creaming&rdquo; Joe Namath with Noxema all snuck into popular culture by amusing audiences.</p><p>This early form of branded content worked well because the entertainment media were oligopolies, so cultural competition was limited. In the United States, three networks produced television programming for 30 weeks or so every year and then went into reruns. Films were distributed only through local movie theaters; similarly, magazine competition was restricted to what fit on the shelves at drugstores. Consumer marketing companies could buy their way to fame by paying to place their brands in this tightly controlled cultural arena.</p><h5>Once audiences could opt out of ads, it became harder for brands to buy fame.</h5><p>Brands also infiltrated culture by sponsoring TV shows and events, attaching themselves to successful content. Since fans had limited access to their favorite entertainers, brands could act as intermediaries. For decades, we were accustomed to fast food chains&rsquo; sponsoring new blockbuster films, luxury autos&rsquo; bringing us golf and tennis competitions, and youth brands&rsquo; underwriting bands and festivals.</p><p>The rise of new technologies that allowed audiences to opt out of ads&mdash;from cable networks to DVRs and then the internet&mdash;made it much harder for brands to buy fame. Now they had to compete directly with real entertainment. So companies upped the ante. BMW pioneered the practice of creating short films for the internet. Soon corporations were hiring top film directors (Michael Bay, Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, Wes Anderson, David Lynch) and pushing for ever-more-spectacular special effects and production values.<br /> These early (pre-social-media) digital efforts led companies to believe that if they delivered Hollywood-level creative at internet speed, they could gather huge engaged audiences around their brands. Thus was born the great push toward branded content. But its champions weren&rsquo;t counting on new competition. And this time it came not from big media companies but from the crowd.</p><h3>The Rise of Crowdculture</h3><p>Historically, cultural innovation flowed from the margins of society&mdash;from fringe groups, social movements, and artistic circles that challenged mainstream norms and conventions. Companies and the mass media acted as intermediaries, diffusing these new ideas into the mass market. But social media has changed everything.</p><p>Social media binds together communities that once were geographically isolated, greatly increasing the pace and intensity of collaboration. Now that these once-remote communities are densely networked, their cultural influence has become direct and substantial. These new crowdcultures come in two flavors: subcultures, which incubate new ideologies and practices, and art worlds, which break new ground in entertainment.</p><h4>Amplified subcultures.</h4><p>Today you&rsquo;ll find a flourishing crowdculture around almost any topic: espresso, the demise of the American Dream, Victorian novels, arts-and-crafts furniture, libertarianism, new urbanism, 3-D printing, anime, bird-watching, homeschooling, barbecue. Back in the day, these subculturalists had to gather physically and had very limited ways to communicate collectively: magazines and, later, primitive Usenet groups and meet-ups.</p><p>Social media has expanded and democratized these subcultures. With a few clicks, you can jump into the center of any subculture, and participants&rsquo; intensive interactions move seamlessly among the web, physical spaces, and traditional media. Together members are pushing forward new ideas, products, practices, and aesthetics&mdash;bypassing mass-culture gatekeepers. With the rise of crowdculture, cultural innovators and their early adopter markets have become one and the same.</p><h4>Turbocharged art worlds.</h4><p>Producing innovative popular entertainment requires a distinctive mode of organization&mdash;what sociologists call an art world. In art worlds, artists (musicians, filmmakers, writers, designers, cartoonists, and so on) gather in inspired collaborative competition: They work together, learn from one another, play off ideas, and push one another. The collective efforts of participants in these &ldquo;scenes&rdquo; often generate major creative breakthroughs. Before the rise of social media, the mass-culture industries (film, television, print media, fashion) thrived by pilfering and repurposing their innovations.</p><p>Crowdculture has turbocharged art worlds, vastly increasing the number of participants and the speed and quality of their interactions. No longer do you need to be part of a local scene; no longer do you need to work for a year to get funding and distribution for your short film. Now millions of nimble cultural entrepreneurs come together online to hone their craft, exchange ideas, fine-tune their content, and compete to produce hits. The net effect is a new mode of rapid cultural prototyping, in which you can get instant data on the market&rsquo;s reception of ideas, have them critiqued, and then rework them so that the most resonant content quickly surfaces. In the process, new talent emerges and new genres form. Squeezing into every nook and cranny of pop culture, the new content is highly attuned to audiences and produced on the cheap. These art-world crowdcultures are the main reason why branded content has failed.</p><h4>Beyond Branded Content</h4><p>While companies have put their faith in branded content for the past decade, brute empirical evidence is now forcing them to reconsider. In YouTube or Instagram rankings of channels by number of subscribers, corporate brands barely appear. Only three have cracked the YouTube Top 500. Instead you&rsquo;ll find entertainers you&rsquo;ve never heard of, appearing as if from nowhere.</p><p>YouTube&rsquo;s greatest success by far is PewDiePie, a Swede who posts barely edited films with snarky voice-over commentary on the video games he plays. By January 2016 he had racked up nearly 11 billion views, and his YouTube channel had more than 41 million subscribers.</p><p>How did this happen? The story begins with the youth subcultures that formed around video games. When they landed on social media, they became a force. The once-oddball video-gaming-as-entertainment subculture of South Korea went global, producing a massive spectator sport, now known as E-Sports, with a fan base approaching 100 million people. (Amazon recently bought the E-Sports network Twitch for $970 million.)</p><p>In E-Sports, broadcasters provide play-by-play narration of video games. PewDiePie and his comrades riffed on this commentary, turning it into a potty-mouthed new form of sophomoric comedy. Other gamers who film themselves, such as VanossGaming (YouTube rank #19, 15.6 million subscribers), elrubiusOMG (#20, 15.6 million), CaptainSparklez (#60, 9 million), and Ali-A (#94, 7.4 million), are also influential members of this tribe. The crowdculture was initially organized by specialized media platforms that disseminated this content and by insider fans who gathered around and critiqued it, hyping some efforts and dissing others. PewDiePie became the star of this digital art world&mdash;just as Jean-Michel Basquiat and Patti Smith had done in urban art worlds back in the analog days. The main difference is that the power of crowdculture propelled him to global fame and influence in record time.</p><p>Gaming comedy is just one of hundreds of new genres that crowdculture has created. Those genres fill every imaginable entertainment gap in popular culture, from girls&rsquo; fashion advice to gross-out indulgent foods to fanboy sports criticism. Brands can&rsquo;t compete, despite their investments. Compare PewDiePie, who cranks out inexpensive videos in his house, to McDonald&rsquo;s, one of the world&rsquo;s biggest spenders on social media. The McDonald&rsquo;s channel (#9,414) has 204,000 YouTube subscribers. PewDiePie is 200 times as popular, for a minuscule fraction of the cost.</p><p>Or consider Red Bull, the most lauded branded-content success story. It has become a new-media hub producing extreme- and alternative-sports content. While Red Bull spends much of its $2 billion annual marketing budget on branded content, its YouTube channel (rank #184, 4.9 million subscribers) is lapped by dozens of crowdculture start-ups with production budgets under $100,000. Indeed, Dude Perfect (#81, 8 million subscribers), the brainchild of five college jocks from Texas who make videos of trick shots and goofy improvised athletic feats, does far better.</p><p>Coca-Cola offers another cautionary tale. In 2011 the company announced a new marketing strategy&mdash;called Liquid &amp; Linked&mdash;with great fanfare. Going all in, it shifted its emphasis from &ldquo;creative excellence&rdquo; (the old mass-media approach) to &ldquo;content excellence&rdquo; (branded content in social media). Coke&rsquo;s Jonathan Mildenhall claimed that Coke would continually produce &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s most compelling content,&rdquo; which would capture &ldquo;a disproportionate share of popular culture,&rdquo; doubling sales by 2020.</p><p>The following year, Coca-Cola launched its first big bet, transforming the static corporate website into a digital magazine, Coca-Cola Journey. It runs stories on virtually every pop culture topic&mdash;from sports and food to sustainability and travel. It&rsquo;s the epitome of a branded-content strategy.<br /> Journey has now been live for over three years, and it barely registers views. It hasn&rsquo;t cracked the top 10,000 sites in the United States or the top 20,000 worldwide. Likewise, the company&rsquo;s YouTube channel (ranked #2,749) has only 676,000 subscribers.</p><p>It turns out that consumers have little interest in the content that brands churn out. Very few people want it in their feed. Most view it as clutter&mdash;as brand spam. When Facebook realized this, it began charging companies to get &ldquo;sponsored&rdquo; content into the feeds of people who were supposed to be their fans.</p><h4>On social media, what works for Shakira backfires for Crest and Clorox.</h4><p>The problem companies face is structural, not creative. Big companies organize their marketing efforts as the antithesis of art worlds, in what I have termed brand bureaucracies. They excel at coordinating and executing complex marketing programs across multiple markets around the world. But this organizational model leads to mediocrity when it comes to cultural innovation.</p><h3>Brand Sponsors Are Disintermediated</h3><p>Entertainment &ldquo;properties&rdquo;&mdash;performers, athletes, sports teams, films, television programs, and video games&mdash;are also hugely popular on social media. Across all the big platforms you&rsquo;ll find the usual A-list of celebrities dominating. On YouTube musicians Rihanna, One Direction, Katy Perry, Eminem, Justin Bieber, and Taylor Swift have built massive audiences. On Twitter you&rsquo;ll find a similar cast of singers, along with media stars like Ellen DeGeneres, Jimmy Fallon, Oprah, Bill Gates, and the pope. Fans gather around the tweets of sports stars Cristiano Ronaldo, LeBron James, Neymar, and Kak&aacute;, and teams such as FC Barcelona and Real Madrid (which are far more popular than the two dominant sports brands, Nike and Adidas). On Instagram you&rsquo;ll find more of the same.</p><p>These celebrities are all garnering the superengaged community that pundits have long promised social media would deliver. But it&rsquo;s not available to companies and their branded goods and services. In retrospect, that shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising: Interacting with a favored entertainer is different from interacting with a brand of rental car or orange juice. What works for Shakira backfires for Crest and Clorox. The idea that consumers could possibly want to talk about Corona or Coors in the same way that they debate the talents of Ronaldo and Messi is silly.<br /> How One Brand Uses Celebrities to Break Through<br /> Under Armour&rsquo;s recent campaign &ldquo;I Will What I Want&rdquo; shows how to combine celebrity sponsorships and cultural branding to create content with impact.</p><p>Under Armour originally became an iconic brand by swiping Nike&rsquo;s cultural strategy&mdash;then doing it one better.</p><p>Nike&rsquo;s approach, launched in the 1970s and perfected in the 1990s, was to tell stories of athletes who overcame societal barriers through sheer willpower. But a decade ago Nike abandoned its competitive-underdog ideology to go all in on branded content, using famous athletes to make entertaining sports films. Under Armour stepped into the void, producing arresting new ads, such as &ldquo;Protect This House,&rdquo; that championed the same ideology and took off on social media.</p><p>Under Armour also followed Nike in dramatizing how &uuml;bercompetitiveness, traditionally associated with masculinity, applied equally to women, broadcasting spots that showcased female athletes. The latest effort, &ldquo;I Will What I Want,&rdquo; pushed gender boundaries even further, challenging conventions in arenas where traditional ideals of femininity still reign.<br /> Ballet star Misty Copeland&mdash;who grew up in poverty with a single parent&mdash;is an athletic, muscular dancer in a profession that celebrates waifish, reed-thin women. Under Armour made a video about how she rose above adversity (the voice-over is from a rejection letter saying that her body was completely wrong for ballet), showing her dancing in a formfitting sports bra and pants that reveal her curvier physique.<br /> A Gisele B&uuml;ndchen film followed the same convention-breaking formula but mashed up incongruous crowdcultures to provoke a social media response. The former Victoria&rsquo;s Secret star is usually portrayed within the glamorous world of runways and celebrity hobnobbing. Under Armour broke the frame by placing her in what was essentially an old Nike ad: a backstage video of Gisele in an intense kickboxing workout. The company announced the partnership ahead of filming. It immediately stirred up the crowdculture: Sports fans were cynical, Gisele fans were curious, fashionistas were puzzled, and feminists simply loved it. Under Armour&rsquo;s agency scraped all this commentary from the web and projected quotes from the digital discussion on the walls behind her. The resulting video shows Gisele sweating and kicking the bag, ignoring the litany of digs surrounding her: &ldquo;Is posing now a sport?&rdquo; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not even pretty.&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s her sport, smiling?&rdquo; &ldquo;Stick to modeling, sweetie.&rdquo;</p><p>Under Armour succeeded because it innovated with ideology&mdash;using female celebrities to provocatively push against gender norms. The company aimed its communiqu&eacute;s directly at the crowdcultures that held those norms, which set off a firestorm of debate.</p><p>Social media allows fans to create rich communities around entertainers, who interact directly with them in a barrage of tweets, pins, and posts. Sports teams now hire social media ambassadors to reach out to fans in real time during games, and once the game is over, the players send along insider photos and hold locker-room chats. Beyond the major platforms, new media sites like Vevo, SoundCloud, and Apple Music are spurring even more direct digital connections.</p><p>Of course, entertainers are still more than happy to take sponsors&rsquo; money, but the cultural value that&rsquo;s supposed to rub off on the brand is fading.</p><h3>Cultural Branding</h3><p>While the rise of crowdculture diminishes the impact of branded content and sponsorships, it has greased the wheels for an alternative approach that I call cultural branding. The dramatic breakthrough of the fast-casual Mexican food chain Chipotle from 2011 to 2013 (before recent outbreaks of foodborne illness) demonstrates the power of this approach.</p><p>Chipotle took advantage of an enormous cultural opportunity created when the once-marginal movements that had challenged America&rsquo;s dominant industrial food culture became a force to be reckoned with on social media. The chain jumped into the fray as a champion of this crowdculture&rsquo;s ideology. By applying cultural branding, Chipotle became one of America&rsquo;s most compelling and talked-about brands (though recent food-safety difficulties have dented its image). Specifically, Chipotle succeeded by following these five principles:</p><h4>1. Map the cultural orthodoxy.</h4><p>In cultural branding, the brand promotes an innovative ideology that breaks with category conventions. To do that, it first needs to identify which conventions to leapfrog&mdash;what I call the cultural orthodoxy. America&rsquo;s industrial food ideology was invented in the early 20th century by food-marketing companies. Americans had come to believe that, through dazzling scientific discoveries (margarine, instant coffee, Tang) and standardized production processes, big companies, overseen by the Food and Drug Administration, would ensure bountiful, healthful, and tasty food. Those assumptions have undergirded the fast food category since McDonald&rsquo;s took off in the 1960s.</p><h4>2. Locate the cultural opportunity.</h4><p>As time passes, disruptions in society cause an orthodoxy to lose traction. Consumers begin searching for alternatives, which opens up an opportunity for innovative brands to push forward a new ideology in their categories.</p><p>How Cultural Branding Builds Icons<br /> Iconic brands are cultural innovators: They leapfrog the conventions of their categories to champion new ideologies that are meaningful to customers.</p><p>As a result, they enjoy intense customer loyalty and superior sales and profits, and garner loads of free media coverage. In business, few achievements are more prized than creating an iconic brand. Yet the two dominant branding models are not designed to do the job.</p><p>The first model, mindshare branding, is one that companies have long relied on. It treats a brand as a set of psychological associations (benefits, emotions, personality). The second model, purpose branding, has become popular in the past decade. In it, a brand espouses values or ideals its customers share. Over the past 15 years I&rsquo;ve developed an alternative approach&mdash;cultural branding&mdash;to turn what was once serendipity into a rigorous discipline. Let me illustrate how it works, using the transformation of Jack Daniel&rsquo;s from a near-bankrupt regional distiller to the maker of the leading premium American whiskey.</p><p>Whiskies compete to be perceived as upscale and masculine. In the 1950s the major brands sought to align themselves with the male ideal of the day: the sophisticated modern corporate executive. Jack Daniel&rsquo;s, a small whiskey targeted to upper-middle-class men, was being trounced by the national competitors. How could it break through?</p><p>Mindshare-branding experts would advise the company to convey, very consistently, the key brand associations: masculine, sophisticated, smooth-tasting, classic. But that was precisely what Jack Daniel&rsquo;s was doing&mdash;its ads mimicked the national brands&rsquo;, showing alpha executives drinking smooth whiskey. And they didn&rsquo;t work. Purpose-branding experts would encourage the firm to champion its core values. With that approach, the focus wouldn&rsquo;t be much different: Those values had to do with producing classic charcoal-filtered whiskey for a sophisticated drinker.</p><p>Instead, the firm (tacitly) pursued a cultural-branding approach. Because masculine ideals are shaped by society, they change over time. The Cold War had dramatically affected Americans&rsquo; perceptions of masculinity. In the face of a nuclear threat, the corporate executive seemed too sedentary. Instead, the public was drawn to what had only recently been viewed as an anachronism: the gunslinging rugged individualist of the Old West, who, in the American mythos, had helped forge the country&rsquo;s success. The enormous popularity of Western films was one indication of this shift. This massive cultural opportunity, which Marlboro and Levi&rsquo;s leveraged as well, is obvious when analyzed through a cultural-branding framework&mdash;but invisible without one.</p><p>The Jack Daniel&rsquo;s distillery was in a rural region of Tennessee that the postwar mass media portrayed as an impoverished land of hillbillies. Yet in the American imagination, the area was also one of the last authentic pockets of the frontier, where Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone had gotten their start. So when American men yearned to revive the ideology of the frontier, the whiskey offered great potential as a symbol. This theme was first hit upon by men&rsquo;s magazines (Fortune, True), which published stories romanticizing the distillery as a place run by frontiersmen, little changed since the 19th century. The company&rsquo;s print-ad campaign simply emulated those stories, adding some folksy copy.</p><p>Jack Daniel&rsquo;s quickly became the aspirational whiskey among urban upper-middle-class men; the branding converted its once-stigmatized location into a place where men were really men. Conventional models would never build a strategy centered on such a downscale version of masculinity. But in cultural branding, inverting marginal ideologies is one of the tricks of the trade.</p><p>For industrial food, the tipping point came in 2001, when Eric Schlosser&rsquo;s book Fast Food Nation powerfully challenged it. This was followed in 2004 by Morgan Spurlock&rsquo;s film Super Size Me and in 2006 by Michael Pollan&rsquo;s influential book The Omnivore&rsquo;s Dilemma. These critiques dramatically affected the upper middle class, quickly spreading concerns about industrial food and providing huge momentum to Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe&rsquo;s, and a host of other upmarket food purveyors. The same transformation is unfolding in other countries dominated by industrial food ideology. For instance, in the United Kingdom the celebrity chefs Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall have played a similar role.</p><p>Before social media, the influence of these works would have remained locked within this small fraction of society. Instead, crowdcultures grabbed the critiques and blew them up, pushing industrial food anxiety into the mainstream. News about every major problem linked to industrial food production&mdash;processed foods loaded with sugar, carcinogenic preservatives, rBGH in milk, bisphenol A leaching from plastics, GMOs, and so on&mdash;began to circulate at internet speed. Videos of the meatlike substance &ldquo;pink slime&rdquo; went viral. Parents worried endlessly about what they were feeding their kids. Crowdculture converted an elite concern into a national social trauma that galvanized a broad public challenge.</p><h4>3. Target the crowdculture.</h4><p>Challengers to the industrial food ideology had lurked at the margins for more than 40 years but had been easily pushed aside as crazy Luddites. Small subcultures had evolved around organic farming and pastured livestock, eking out a living at the fringes of the market in community-supported agriculture and farmers&rsquo; markets. But as social media took off, an influential and diverse cluster of overlapping subcultures pushed hard for food innovations. They included advocates of evolutionary nutrition and paleo diets, sustainable ranchers, a new generation of environmental activists, urban gardeners, and farm-to-table restaurants. In short order, a massive cultural movement had organized around the revival of preindustrial foods. Chipotle succeeded because it jumped into this crowdculture and took on its cause.</p><h4>4. Diffuse the new ideology.</h4><p>Chipotle promoted preindustrial food ideology with two films. In 2011 the company launched Back to the Start, an animated film with simple wooden figures. In it, an old-fashioned farm is transformed into a parody of a hyper-rationalized industrial farm: The pigs are stuffed together inside a concrete barn, then enter an assembly line where they are injected with chemicals that fatten them into blimps, and then are pressed into cubes and deposited in a fleet of semis. The farmer is haunted by this transformation and decides to convert his farm back to its original pastoral version.</p><p>Crowdculture converted an elite concern into a national social trauma.</p><p>The second film, The Scarecrow, parodied an industrial food company that branded its products using natural farm imagery. The company is actually a factory in which animals are injected with drugs and treated inhumanely. It cranks out premade meals stamped &ldquo;100% beef-ish&rdquo; that kids, oblivious to the real process, eagerly gobble up. A scarecrow who works at the factory is depressed by what he witnesses until he gets an idea. He picks a bunch of produce from his garden, takes it to the city, and opens up a little taqueria&mdash;a facsimile of a Chipotle.</p><p>The films were launched with tiny media buys and then seeded out on social media platforms. Both were extremely influential, were watched by tens of millions, generated huge media hits, and helped drive impressive sales and profit gains. Each won the Grand Prix at the Cannes advertising festival.</p><p>Chipotle&rsquo;s films are wrongly understood simply as great examples of branded content. They worked because they went beyond mere entertainment. The films were artful, but so are many thousands of films that don&rsquo;t cut through. Their stories weren&rsquo;t particularly original; they had been repeated over and over with creative vigor for the previous decade or so. But they exploded on social media because they were myths that passionately captured the ideology of the burgeoning preindustrial food crowdculture. Chipotle painted an inspired vision of America returning to bucolic agricultural and food production traditions and reversing many problems in the dominant food system.</p><p>The b&ecirc;te noire of the preindustrial food movement is fast food, so the idea that a major fast food company would promote that story was particularly potent with the crowd. Chipotle was taking on pink slime! Moreover, boutique locavore food was expensive, but at Chipotle people could now assuage their worries with a $7 burrito. Because they tapped into anxieties percolating in the crowdculture, Chipotle&rsquo;s films never had to compete as great entertainment.</p><h4>5. Innovate continually, using cultural flashpoints.</h4><p>A brand can sustain its cultural relevance by playing off particularly intriguing or contentious issues that dominate the media discourse related to an ideology. That&rsquo;s what Ben &amp; Jerry&rsquo;s did so well in championing its sustainable business philosophy. The company used new-product introductions to playfully spar with the Reagan administration on timely issues such as nuclear weapons, the destruction of the rain forests, and the war on drugs.</p><p>To thrive, Chipotle must continue to lead on flashpoint issues with products and communiqu&eacute;s. The company has been less successful in this respect: It followed up with a Hulu series that had little social media impact because it simply mimicked the prior films rather than staking out new flashpoints. Then Chipotle moved on to a new issue, championing food without GMOs. Aside from the fact that this claim challenged its credibility (after all, Chipotle still sold meat fed by GMO grain and soft drinks made with GMO sweeteners), GMO was a relatively weak flashpoint, a contentious issue only among the most activist consumers and already touted by many hundreds of products. These efforts failed to rally the crowdculture. A number of other flashpoints, such as sugary drinks and industrial vegetable oils, generate far more controversy and have yet to be tackled by a major food business.</p><p>Of course, leading with ideology in the mass market can be a double-edged sword. The brand has to walk the walk or it will be called out. Chipotle is a large and growing business with many industrial-scale processes, not a small farm-to-table taqueria. Delivering perishable fresh food, which the company is committed to as a preindustrial food champion, is a huge operational challenge. Chipotle&rsquo;s reputation has taken a painful hit with highly publicized outbreaks of E. coli and norovirus contamination. Chipotle won&rsquo;t win back consumer trust through ads or public relations efforts. Rather, the company has to convince the crowdculture that it&rsquo;s doubling down on its commitment to get preindustrial food right, and then the crowd will advocate for its brand once again.</p><h3>Competing for Crowdcultures</h3><p>To brand effectively with social media, companies should target crowdcultures. Today, in pursuit of relevance, most brands chase after trends. But this is a commodity approach to branding: Hundreds of companies are doing exactly the same thing with the same generic list of trends. It&rsquo;s no wonder consumers don&rsquo;t pay attention. By targeting novel ideologies flowing out of crowdcultures, brands can assert a point of view that stands out in the overstuffed media environment.<br /> Take the personal care category. Three brands&mdash;Dove, Axe, and Old Spice&mdash;have generated tremendous consumer interest and identification in a historically low-involvement category, one you would never expect to get attention on social media. They succeeded by championing distinctive gender ideologies around which crowdcultures had formed.</p><p>Axe mines the lad crowd. In the 1990s feminist critiques of patriarchal culture were promulgated by academics in American universities. These attacks whipped up a conservative backlash mocking &ldquo;politically correct&rdquo; gender politics. It held that men were under siege and needed to rekindle their traditional masculinity. In the UK and then the United States, this rebellion gave rise to a tongue-in-cheek form of sexism called &ldquo;lad culture.&rdquo; New magazines like Maxim, FHM, and Loaded harked back to the Playboy era, featuring lewd stories with soft-porn photos. This ideology struck a chord with many young men. By the early 2000s lad culture was migrating onto the web as a vital crowdculture.</p><p>Axe (sold as Lynx in the UK and Ireland) had been marketed in Europe and Latin America since the 1980s but had become a dated, also-ran brand. That is, until the company jumped onto the lad bandwagon with &ldquo;The Axe Effect,&rdquo; a campaign that pushed to bombastic extremes politically incorrect sexual fantasies. It spread like wildfire on the internet and instantly established Axe as the over-the-top cheerleader for the lad crowd.</p><p>By targeting novel ideologies from crowdcultures, brands can stand out.</p><p>Dove leads the body-positive crowd. Axe&rsquo;s aggressive stand set up a perfect opportunity for another brand to champion the feminist side of this &ldquo;gender war.&rdquo; Dove was a mundane, old-fashioned brand in a category in which marketing usually rode the coattails of the beauty trends set by fashion houses and media. By the 2000s the ideal of the woman&rsquo;s body had been pushed to ridiculous extremes. Feminist critiques of the use of starved size 0 models began to circulate in traditional and social media. Instead of presenting an aspiration, beauty marketing had become inaccessible and alienating to many women.</p><p>Dove&rsquo;s &ldquo;Campaign for Real Beauty&rdquo; tapped into this emerging crowdculture by celebrating real women&rsquo;s physiques in all their normal diversity&mdash;old, young, curvy, skinny, short, tall, wrinkled, smooth. Women all over the world pitched in to produce, circulate, and cheer for images of bodies that didn&rsquo;t conform to the beauty myth. Throughout the past decade, Dove has continued to target cultural flashpoints&mdash;such as the use of heavily Photoshopped images in fashion magazines&mdash;to keep the brand at the center of this gender discourse.</p><p>Old Spice taps the hipster crowd. The ideological battle between the laddish view and body-positive feminism left untouched one other cultural opportunity in the personal care market. In the 2000s, a new &ldquo;hipster&rdquo; ideology arose in urban subcultures to define sophistication among young cosmopolitan adults. They embraced the historical bohemian ideal with gusto but also with self-referential irony. Ironic white-trash wardrobes (foam trucker hats, ugly Salvation Army sweaters) and facial hair (waxed handlebar mustaches, bushy beards) became pervasive. Brooklyn was chock-full of lumberjacks. Amplified by crowdculture, this sensibility rapidly spread across the country.</p><p>Old Spice branding piggybacked on hipster sophistication with a parody of Axe and masculine clich&eacute;s. The campaign featured a chiseled, bare-chested former football player, Isaiah Mustafa, as a huckster for Old Spice&mdash;&ldquo;the man your man could smell like.&rdquo; The films hit the hipster bull&rsquo;s-eye, serving up an extremely &ldquo;hot&rdquo; guy whose shtick is to make fun of the conventions of male attractiveness. You too can be hot if you offer your woman amazing adventures, diamonds and gold, and studly body poses, all with aggressive spraying of Old Spice.</p><p>These three brands broke through in social media because they used cultural branding&mdash;a strategy that works differently from the conventional branded-content model. Each engaged a cultural discourse about gender and sexuality in wide circulation in social media&mdash;a crowdculture&mdash;which espoused a distinctive ideology. Each acted as a proselytizer, promoting this ideology to a mass audience. Such opportunities come into view only if we use the prism of cultural branding&mdash;doing research to identify ideologies that are relevant to the category and gaining traction in crowdcultures. Companies that rely on traditional segmentation models and trend reports will always have trouble identifying those opportunities.</p><p>A decade in, companies are still struggling to come up with a branding model that works in the chaotic world of social media. The big platforms&mdash;the Facebooks and YouTubes and Instagrams&mdash;seem to call the shots, while the vast majority of brands are cultural mutes, despite investing billions. Companies need to shift their focus away from the platforms themselves and toward the real locus of digital power&mdash;crowdcultures. They are creating more opportunities than ever for brands. Old Spice succeeded not with a Facebook strategy but with a strategy that leveraged the ironic hipster aesthetic. Chipotle succeeded not with a YouTube strategy but with products and communications that spoke to the preindustrial food movement. Companies can once again win the battle for cultural relevance with cultural branding, which will allow them to tap into the power of the crowd.</p><p> </p>",

        "content": "<p>JANUARY 21, 2016 — Rich Fernandez — HBR<br />It can be tough enough to manage your own stress. But how can you, as a manager, help the members of your team handle their feelings of stress, burnout, or disengagement?</p><p>Because work is getting more demanding and complex, and because many of us now work in 24/7 environments, anxiety and burnout are not uncommon. In our high-pressure workplaces, staying productive and engaged can be challenging.</p><p>Although it’s unlikely that the pace or intensity of work will change much anytime soon, there’s a growing body of research that suggests certain types of development activities can effectively build the capacity for resilience.</p><p>One approach is to focus on employees’ personal growth and development. When I was working at Google as the director of executive development, for example, we focused on helping managers create the “happiest, healthiest, and most productive workforce on the planet.” Investing in employee personal growth and development from this perspective is the first step in unleashing creativity, enabling potential, and supporting sustainable productivity.<br />The good news is that there are some very practical and easy-to-implement approaches to personal development that managers and team members can adopt — and they aren’t time-, budget-, or resource-intensive. Here are some approaches to consider, based on the two decades I’ve spent working with managers to enhance team resilience and effectiveness.</p><p>Model and encourage well-being practices. Worker stress levels are rising, with over half of the global workforce (53%) reporting that they are closer to burnout than they were just five years ago, according to a Regus Group survey of over 22,000 business people across 100 countries. And while stress can be contagious, the converse is also true: when any member of a team experiences well-being, the effect seems to spread across the entire team. According to a recent Gallup research report that surveyed 105 teams over six three-month periods, individual team members who reported experiencing well-being were 20% more likely to have other team members who also reported thriving six months later. Takeaway: understand and prioritize activities that promote well-being for yourself and your team. They could include such things as offering personal development tools, like mindfulness and resilience training; explicitly encouraging people to take time for exercise or other renewal activities, such as walking meetings; or building buffer time into deliverables calendars so that people can work flexibly and at a manageable pace.</p><p>Allow time to disconnect outside of work. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, workers around the world spend 34 to 48 hours at work each week on average, and many engage in work or related activities after business hours. McKinsey Quarterly suggests that “always-on, multitasking work environments are killing productivity, dampening creativity, and making us unhappy.” And one of the most significant findings in employee pulse surveys that I’ve seen in companies large and small is that employees have an exceptionally hard time disconnecting from work.</p><p>While the rigors of a high-performance culture may require consistent focus, “always on” is a dangerous and unproductive mindset because it fails to take recovery time into account. Even the best athletes on the best teams require time to rest and recover. So be intentional about when you expect team members (and yourself) to engage in the office or digitally, and be intentional and explicit about when not to engage. No emails after 8 PM or on weekends, for example.</p><p>Train the brain to deal with chaos. Neuroscience research shows that the practice of mindfulness can systematically train the brain and create useful mental habits that promote resilience and productivity at work (and in life). At Wisdom Labs, we notice that leaders and teams who train their brains to develop mindfulness collaborate better, navigate stress more effectively, and sustain high performance. You don’t have be an expert in mindfulness to help yourself and team members develop this innate human capacity. Technology can be helpful, too: Try out a few mindfulness apps or devices yourself, and pass them on. Good apps include Calm, Headspace, and the Muse.</p><p>Emphasize “monotasking” for better focus. Multitasking is a myth. Humans are not effective or efficient parallel processors (computers are). Neuroscientist, educational researcher, and author JoAnn Deak, Ph.D., notes that multitasking typically “doubles the amount of time it takes to do a task, and it usually at least doubles the number of mistakes.” People are best at “serial monotasking.” Managers can encourage monotasking by helping team members with clear, one-at-a-time task prioritization for deliverables, defining milestones that don’t overlap, and generally avoiding the trap of mistaking the urgent for the important.</p><p>Be purposeful about “gap” time during the work day, or slow periods over the course of the working year. Be deliberate about helping people pause and recharge during down cycles or lulls in work activity. If there are no down cycles, work hard as a manager to create some. According to Linda Stone, former head of Microsoft University, there is a tendency for people to be pulled toward always being a live node at work, an “always-on, anywhere, anytime, any place behavior” that results in suboptimal and dissatisfying state of “continuous partial attention.” Give people buffer time to recharge and refocus.<br />Author and management consultant Tony Schwartz suggests that managers understand work is not a marathon but a series of sprints that requires recovery and renewal time in between (say, 90 minutes of focused work followed by a 10-minute break). It’s not the number of hours people work that matters, it’s the value they produce during the hours they work. So stop worrying about how many hours someone spends at his desk, and start figuring out “What can I do to help this person design his schedule so that when he’s working, he’s really working?”</p><p>Exercise empathy and compassion. It doesn’t cost anything to be kind, and the benefits for managers are great. Empathy and compassion significantly improve employee performance, engagement, and profitability. A seminal research project at the University of New South Wales, which looked at 5,600 people across 77 organizations, found that “the single greatest influence on profitability and productivity within an organization…is the ability of leaders to spend more time and effort developing and recognizing their people, welcoming feedback, including criticism, and fostering co-operation among staff.” Additionally, the research found that the ability of a leader to be compassionate – “to understand people’s motivators, hopes, and difficulties and to create the right support mechanism to allow people to be as good as they can be” – has the greatest correlation with profitability and productivity. Empathy and compassion are good for people and good for business.</p><p>What kind of return on investment can managers expect for these efforts? At Aetna Insurance, more than 12,000 employees participating in mindfulness programs offered by the company showed an average of 62 minutes per week of enhanced productivity, saving the company $3,000 per employee annually. More generally, an iOpener Institute study found that in mid-sized companies, happy workplaces had a 46% reduction in turnover, 19% reduction in the cost of sick leave, and 12% increase in performance and productivity. The happiest employees spent 46% more of their time focused on work tasks and felt 65% more energized than their colleagues. Finally, at a macro level, research by HR consultancy Towers Watson found that companies in which employees experienced sustainable engagement, defined as emotional engagement as well as a sense of being enabled and energized by work, had twice the earnings and nearly three times the gross profit of companies that had average to low levels of engagement.</p><p>You may be asking yourself, “Is it really my job as a manager to focus on people’s resilience? To encourage them to practice mindfulness?” According to recent research published by Gallup, the view that employees should leave their personal lives at home “might sound sensible, but it’s totally unrealistic.” Gallup analysis shows that “our well-being has an impact on the people we work with, and on the people who work for us.” Managers, therefore, really do need to focus on what Monika Broecker, founder of the Center for Personal Growth, describes as “upgrading mental and emotional capabilities.”</p><p>The bottom line for managers is that personal development makes each person, and the entire team, better, enabling higher performance and engagement over time. Doing well at work and encouraging people to feel well isn’t just possible — it’s the foundation of a high-performance team.</p>",

If we can get out of the caricature of the word “army.” They say the army is very hierarchical…But I&#8217;ve seen more extreme hierarchy in the business than in the army. The Navy has said that there are no unimportant jobs—every job is essential. An organization’s largest error in is prioritizing the business and suggesting that there some “lesser” or unessential jobs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It is, in fact, important to keep morale up in employees. How do you find the balance between autonomy and team spirit?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a connection between “I” and “Us.” The more a person is recognized, motivated, and valued the better will perform his tasks. But if we do that, we promote an individualism that is difficult to manage. So, we must also work on the “Us” part.

The problem with hierarchal companies is that people are experiencing very different things, allowing for a large disconnect.</p><p>Head management often knows nothing about the core of the business; what is happening in factories, what goes on day-to-day in lower offices, etc. That said, digitalization will not change that. It is just a tool that allows everyone to have the same information at the same time. The best way to manage a team is to understand all aspects of the company and its jobs, to get a dose reality, to do the job with them.No Business Executive bothers to get dirty, to work with the team, they are afraid of contact.

I created C.L.E.F in 1992, a training company in the health sector that I later sold to EY, where I specialized in the health insurance. I was the Vice-President for Health Care at CapGemini when I decided to create La Voie Des Hommes (LVDH – aka the Man Path) in 2003. Throughout my successive work experiences, I have always wanted to develop everyone’s talent and skills. My career path has always been about empowerment and natural talents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How did you get involved in social innovation? </strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>I think social innovation takes roots in the behavior and human interactions. The consulting sector works on social innovation by thinking the future of workplace, customer relations and individual behaviors. Consulting companies and LVDH observes the implicit changes of our time to empower consultants. My motto is George B. Shaw’s famous quote: “people are always blaming their circumstances for what they are. I don’t believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can’t find them, make them”.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What were the big companies “walls” you identified during your career?</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Work is all about relation and mutual agreement, how you consider the contract between the individual and the institution. As 2016 Nobel Prize winners Hart and Holmström argue, we have to rethink how we conceive incentives at work. Big institutions and companies see it as external incentives, based on salary and long-term contract. That is how they build security. Long-term contract is overrated, not only for national economy stakes and performances, but at the individual scale as well. New generations defined their own security and liberty at work with internal incentives based on three ideas: autonomy, capacity-building work environment and collective goals. Big companies see theses changes &#8211; that LVDH wants to support &#8211; but don&#8217;t go for it.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>How does LVDH break the walls?</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>We break the walls by creating the desire to work together and we promote an environment of self-determination in the workplace. People at work are motivated because they are passionate. Empowerment comes with the feeling to enhance others’ lives. LVDH is a new kind of company based on relation as our main work resource. LVDH creates a “pure work relation” by working without hierarchy, authority or prisoner dilemma about income. We think that the company of tomorrow will be made of “frogs”, people going back and forth, from office and projects. This is a new generation of companies that has to be created.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>LVDH promotes do-fair. Can you tell us about it?</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>LVDH creates a common-good community based on trust. We offer individuals the opportunity to empower each other. LVDH doesn’t keep money and redistributes all the wealth created by the work of the community. It creates a collective credibility and a prosperous interaction as every consultant in LVDH shares their skills to others with our 350 free talents and 57 different professions of our community. Actually, the “parable of the talent” sums it up perfectly. This is how we define our do-fair policy.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>You also break walls by changing work relations paradigms!</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Yes, we organize lectures, workshops and dinners that help to think differently for freelancers. When you are a consultant, the flagship product is you. People often think that you have to market yourself and brand your work to be “sell”. In fact, LVDH offers to reverse the paradigms and to become the buyer and see why someone would be interest in buying you. We think the question “how to be bought” is more relevant than “how to market yourself”. We also thought about how to manage egos in the workplace with the module “co-production with divas”: the title is a bit provocative but it means that consultants sometimes have to deal with egos&#8230;and their own egos too! We offer tools to manage this!</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>How does LVDH generate liberty at work?</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Liberty is the faculty to choose your own obligations. The future is still innocent when it is not too influenced by your past. LVDH offers consultants the possibility to regain their own liberty, which leads to happiness at work. Director of 75-year-old Harvard study on adult development Robert Walsinger said: &#8220;liberty, success and happiness are based on relations&#8221;. All along my career path, I have tried to work on creating this relation. And through 25 years of work, I have never had any judicial litigation. Today, I work on empowering paradoxical individuals by helping them finding their own definition of liberty.</p><p><strong> </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

Most companies today are implementing some sort of content marketing strategy; but some are still left wondering about its efficacy.</p><p> </p><p>Let us first, then, look at some powerful statistics about content marketing from the Content Marketing Institute:</p><ol><li>Nine in ten organizations market with content</li><li>70% of consumers report that they prefer getting information through articles rather than ads</li><li>Content marking can cost nearly 60% <em>less</em> than traditional marketing strategies</li><li>78% of marketing experts, as reported in one study, say that custom content is the future of marketing</li><li>60% of consumers feel more positive about a company after reading custom content on its site</li></ol><p> </p><p>Most of these statistics were reported on the Content Marketing Institute&rsquo;s website in 2010. Since then, we have seen an increase in the amount of content marketing strategies and can only predict this trend to continue.</p><p> </p><p>The goal of this content marketing, like any marketing strategy, is to increase profit. Content marketing has the advantage of being cheaper than traditional marketing strategies&mdash;raising the profit margins.</p><p> </p><p>While this trend continues, we can also expect the need for highly specialized content writers and marketers to increase. As more companies start implementing content marketing strategies it will become increasingly important to stand out from the crowd of other businesses in the same field. It is no longer effective to <em>just</em> market with content; now content must stand out as the most reliable, innovative, and relevant within its field.</p><p> </p><p>There is plethora of content marketing experts, studies, and surveys that tell us what makes for the best type of content. For example, several suggest that format is the most important aspect of your content. Big chunks of text, they say, turns readers away. Instead they recommend shorter paragraphs, breaking things into sub-sections, and utilizing bullet points whenever possible. (article about big chunks of text)</p><p> </p><p>While types, format, and relativity are all important for content marketing, it may not be enough. Due to the increasing amount of online businesses, simply having good, well formatted content is no longer the primary focus. Instead, things like Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and social media sharing are becoming vital.</p><p> </p><p>This shift in priorities has quite an effect on content writers. Previously, it was sufficient to be a talented writer with an understanding of marketing. Now, however, you must also understand SEO and possess a knowledge of current viral trends to optimize the chances of social media sharing.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>",

What would you categorize your career as?</strong></p><p>I first came across my passion for literature very early in school. I later pursued a career in teaching and became a professor at a college in France. More recently, I worked in HR for a U.S. tech company. And finally, I started my own company called &ldquo;Cadre Noir&rdquo; and currently work as a writer, speaker, and consultant. Some of the companies I work with currently include WantMoreWork, WillBe Group, Switch Collective, and The Consumer Goods Forum. </p><p><strong>Being self-employed, what do you look for in companies you consider working with? What is most important to you in terms of writing/working with a company?</strong></p><p>I primarily focus on HR and &ldquo;future of work&rdquo; topics. So, when considering taking on new clients or working with a new company, I look for stimulating subjects and ideas. </p><p>My experience lies in &ldquo;future of work&rdquo;, HR and digital transformation topics, so I look for projects related to those topics, with inspiring people. WantMoreWork has a very innovative idea and the team is inspiring. </p><p><strong>There have been radical changes in HR and consulting during the last few years. Can you briefly explain some of those changes? Why do you think some of these changes are happening?</strong></p><p>I think the most noticeable shift in HR is due to a change in the culture. For example, the &ldquo;work/life&rdquo; balance has shifted. Increasingly few people will be satisfied with a 9-to-5 (let alone a 9-to-10) job. More people have reported that they want more flexibility and autonomy, and Generation Y doesn&rsquo;t want the bureaucratic environment at all. With that, it is increasingly hard to recruit employees. Companies, in response, have shifted to hiring on a project-by-project basis rather than by hiring in-house. This then pushes the &ldquo;self-employed&rdquo; or &ldquo;contracting&rdquo; world further along. </p><p>Concurrently, the business of consulting is shifting. Big tech companies like Facebook do not hire consultants at all because they don&rsquo;t think traditional consulting firms can help them remain innovative. More companies look to engineers and data scientists to help them make data-driven decisions. What role will traditional consultants play in that changed landscape? They will have to reinvent their value proposition.</p>",

But then I found precious advice of Jordan Roper, a popular freelancer, who talked about how to optimize my LinkedIn profile. I did exactly what she said to&hellip; and a couple of weeks later I was contacted by Wantmore.work. So it clearly worked! I would definitely recommend LinkedIn as a powerful tool for anyone looking to expand their network.</div><div dir=\"ltr\"> </div><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>You talked about how you disliked your old job and had a passion for writing. How, specifically, did you decide to become a freelancer&ndash; as opposed to a journalist or a novel writer, perhaps? </strong></p><div dir=\"ltr\">I chose freelance for a number of reasons. I have always been a self-starter and loved the idea of being in charge of myself, my own schedule and taking my work anywhere I like. I can work from home, a coffee shop, or while a travel&hellip; That was probably the most persuasive reason.</div><div dir=\"ltr\"> </div><div dir=\"ltr\">I also work better on deadlines as opposed to hourly schedules.</div><div dir=\"ltr\"> </div><div dir=\"ltr\">Being a freelancer made it possible for me to explore different types of writing, I could write for a number of different clients, about all different topics. I have already learned so much new information just from doing research for my different clients.</div><div dir=\"ltr\"> </div><div dir=\"ltr\">Aside from being a good writer, there was no &ldquo;qualifications&rdquo; for becoming a freelance writer. Sure, at first it is hard to secure clients and establish a reputation for yourself, but there was no schooling or experience needed to start. It was raw talent, as I had no contacts in the business, that propelled my freelance career at first.</div><div dir=\"ltr\"> </div><p dir=\"ltr\">All that said, I will probably not work as a freelance writer for my entire life. I like working as an Editorial Manager and freelancing on the side now. However, I am an entrepreneur, and while I can imagine myself in the editorial/writing business for quite some time, I am always looking for new business ventures. But right now being a freelancer (and Editorial Manger) suits my needs and my lifestyle perfectly.</p><div dir=\"ltr\"> </div><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>As you primarily work remotely, can you describe what a typical day looks life for you?</strong></p><div dir=\"ltr\"> </div><p dir=\"ltr\">I start working quite early in the morning in order to sync with WantMore.Work (there&rsquo;s a big time difference between Washington state and France!). I also decided to take some classes at university, so I usually attend class from 11am and 2pm. In the afternoon I write, work on templates, do assignments, etc.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">My schedule is very flexible: depending on the workload or the mood of the day, I can finish at completely different times.</p><div dir=\"ltr\"> </div><p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What&rsquo;s your view on what the market looks like for freelance writers?</strong></p><div dir=\"ltr\"> </div><p dir=\"ltr\">The market has expanded rapidly. Many companies understand, or are least following the trend, that content is key.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Increasingly, I see companies add blog portions to their sites and emphasizing their written content. As more and more companies are developing and going online, it is important to have content and products that stand out. This gives more value to writers with additional skills like SEO and content marketing. Tech companies, in particular, are now paying top dollar for good content. I&rsquo;m hopeful that the market will continue to expand and there will continue to be work writers.</p>",

        "content": "<p>JANUARY 2017 &ndash; Laetitia Vitaud</p><p>The phrase &ldquo;working class&rdquo; is not much in use anymore as it is associated to a supposedly outdated political vision of the economy. Most journalists and politicians now use the phrase &ldquo;middle class&rdquo;, which is conveniently devoid of any political dimension &mdash; and devoid of any meaning actually. Yet wealth inequalities have increased tremendously in the past four decades: the least you can say is that the &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; (whoever they may be) have not taken the lion share of the wealth created by the economy. The less the media spoke of a &ldquo;working class&rdquo;, the weaker and poorer they became!</p><p>Wealth distribution is the result of corporate and social contracts that are anything but static and natural. They are the product of power struggles that are political by nature. To regard those contracts as a given is to deprive workers of their political leverage. For nearly 50 years the negotiating power of the workers has been shrinking as the industrial sector has nearly disappeared. Outside their unionised industrial and public sector strongholds, workers have lost political conscience, influence and wealth. Are service sector workers and digital platforms labourers doomed to insignificance and powerlessness?</p><p>No! In itself digital does not necessarily bring about precariousness, contrary to what Neo-Luddites like to claim. Digital can be used in all sorts of ways. Good or bad. Digital is not even the issue. The issue is politics. It is to make the working class political again. You can start by using the phrase &ldquo;working class&rdquo; again: a group that has a political conscience, common interests, and the will to organise and stand united to leverage its power. Then digital can help multiply and spread a movement faster and more strongly than ever before in history.</p><p>In the US, new workers movements have recently achieved tremendous success. For the first time in over four decades, the fate of the precarious service sector workers has improved noticeably. In many states and many companies, these movements have fought for and sometimes obtained higher minimum wages and better working conditions. Despite Donald Trump&rsquo;s victory (whose administration will not defend the introduction of a high national minimum wage), these movements are poised to become stronger in the next few years. And most of all, they are an endless source of inspiration for workers across the world, be they digital or not, independent contractors or salaried workers.</p><h4><strong>How much a worker takes home is the result of a contract</strong></h4><p>Corporations create value. It is a corporation&rsquo;s natural purpose to do so. But the way that value is distributed varies through time. There are basically 4 parties to a corporate contract: 1. the shareholders (those who own the company) ; 2. the executives (those who run it) ; 3. the employees (those who labour to produce the products or services that the company sells) ; and 4. the customers (those who buy from the company).</p><p>Throughout history the influence of each of these parties has changed, depending on political institutions (those in turn depend on the lobbying power of each party), market evolutions, the degree of globalisation, cultural evolutions&hellip; Often one party formed an alliance with another to wield more power. During the post-war boom years, a combination of factors made it possible for executives and employees to form a strong and durable alliance to capture a big chunk of the value.</p><p>In the fordist system, influential unions had a strong negotiating power and made sure employees took home their fair share of whatever value was created. However, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that deal was not the result of power struggles. Nothing was ever given the workers without fights. As Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers for more than 2 decades, and one of history&rsquo;s most influential union men, once said:</p><blockquote><p><em>Our fight is essentially a fight to make democracy work. Democracy is not something that is abstract. We have the practical job as organized labor, as the vanguard of the democratic progressive forces of this nation, of forging the weapons with which we are going to fight and the tools with which we are going to build. Nobody else is going to do the job that must be done unless we in the American labor movement give leadership and directions in that struggle. </em><strong><em><br /> &ndash; 11th UAW-CIO Convention, Nov. 9, 1947</em></strong></p></blockquote><figure><div><div> </div><div data-image-id=\"1*Xxy1s158AhNwP6d3TL99gA.png\" data-width=\"2800\" data-height=\"1400\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*Xxy1s158AhNwP6d3TL99gA.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"75\" height=\"37\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Xxy1s158AhNwP6d3TL99gA.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Xxy1s158AhNwP6d3TL99gA.png\" /></div></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Influence is a construct. It takes years to build it. It takes coalitions. It takes storytelling. And it can never be taken for granted.</p><h4><strong>Something went wrong when the industrial sector nearly disappeared</strong></h4><p>Much has been written about the waning power of unions and the disappearance of the industrial working class. Put simply service sector workers, among whom domestic workers and cleaning women, never wielded the same political power as the mostly white mostly male industrial workers. Not only was it more difficult for a geographically disparate workforce working in homes and different small companies to bargain collectively (you may already see where I&rsquo;m going with digital, here!), but the female and African-American workers were also intentionally discriminated against by powerful political forces. As Tamara Draut writes in an exciting new book titled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Giant-Working-Transform-America-ebook/dp/B011G3BW06\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sleeping-Giant-Working-Transform-America-ebook/dp/B011G3BW06\"><em>Sleeping Giant</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;When the working class shifted from &lsquo;making stuff&rsquo; to &lsquo;serving people&rsquo;, it brought with it lots of historical baggage. The long-standing &lsquo;others&rsquo; in our society &mdash; women and people of color &mdash; became a much larger share of the non-college-educated workforce. And their marginalised status in our society carried over into the working class, making it easier to overlook and devalue their work.&rdquo;</em></p></blockquote><p>Those who served others never won the same bargaining power. In the South in particular, many domestic workers and cleaning personnel were Blacks, the descendants of the &lsquo;house slaves&rsquo; of antebellum years. Franklin Delano Roosevelt intentionally excluded them (domestic workers and field workers) from the groundbreaking Social Security scheme he created in 1935. They were not to get their fair share of anything because the democrats needed the political support of the southern racists to create the new institution. To make things better for industrial workers, they had to leave out service sector and agricultural workers.</p><p>So, as the industrial sector progressively went extinct (or nearly extinct), the working class was increasingly composed of a disparate group of women and racially diverse individuals who had no history of political influence. The extinction of the traditional industrial working class meant workers would lose their political power. Service sector workers started out burdened with a discriminatory legacy that would prove hard to overcome. Power could not simply be shifted from industry to services&hellip;</p><p>Because the new service sector workers were weak from the start, all the other parties (shareholders, executives, customers) lobbied politicians to weaken them further, which is how it became nearly impossible for them to start organising. While the typical GM worker was a strong force in the 1960s, the typical Walmart worker was a disenfranchised weakling in the 1990s. Traditional unions, almost exclusively busy with industrial workers, would become waning organisations of middle-aged and elderly white men. (In Britain, the under-35s, who are almost 40% of the workforce, account for less than a quarter of trade union membership. The figures are nearly the same in the US).</p><h4><strong>But the working class is now making a comeback</strong></h4><p>The emergence of newly organised service sector working class is precisely the subject of Tamara Draut&rsquo;s <em>Sleeping Giant. </em>With new movements like <a href=\"http://fightfor15.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://fightfor15.org/\">FightFor15</a>, <a href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://blacklivesmatter.com/\">Black Lives Matter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/our-walmart-funding_us_574f4b70e4b0eb20fa0cac8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/our-walmart-funding_us_574f4b70e4b0eb20fa0cac8b\">OURWalmart</a> <em>etc.</em> she believes the working class is making a comeback as a political force.</p><p>For the first time in decades, the lowest-paid are organising for better pay and better work conditions. There is more working-class solidarity than &ldquo;<em>at any time since the 1970s</em>&rdquo;, she writes. OURWalmart&mdash;an association of Walmart workers who fight for better working conditions at stores across the country&mdash;and the Fight for $15 are two movements that have brought about considerable change.</p><p>Walmart decided last year to give millions of employees a raise&mdash;which, for the largest employer in the nation, does have quite a bit of an impact. Following the strikes and demonstrations organised by the Fight for $15 movement, the state of New York State decided to raise the state minimum wage to $15 an hour (by December 31, 2021). It has led to higher wages for workers all across the US as similar legislation was passed in Los Angeles, Seattle, and San Francisco.</p><blockquote><p>With OURWalmart and the Fight for $15, the major unions have dusted off their playbook and recommitted to Labor&rsquo;s historical mission of &lsquo;organizing the unorganized</p></blockquote><figure><div><div> </div><div data-image-id=\"1*z1djzZ8g01bVQIioFXUlvw.png\" data-width=\"330\" data-height=\"499\" data-scroll=\"native\"><canvas width=\"50\" height=\"75\"></canvas><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z1djzZ8g01bVQIioFXUlvw.png\" alt=\"\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z1djzZ8g01bVQIioFXUlvw.png\" /></div></div></figure><h4> </h4><h4>The particular challenges of organising the unorganised</h4><p>For a formerly completely unorganised and disparate group, organisation does not come easy. Plus the barriers to organisation are huge. Many of the &lsquo;<em>independent contractors</em>&rsquo; of the new economy are in fact highly dependent, but categorised as &lsquo;independent&rsquo; for the sole purpose of stopping them from organising and becoming a political force. The misclassification of workers as independent contractors includes many of the lowest-paid jobs (janitorial workers, truck drivers, <em>etc.</em>) who are thus deprived of benefits and the right to join a union. Many companies use the system simply to avoid paying payroll taxes and healthcare benefits to workers who should be regular employees.</p><p>Who exactly should be classified as an independent contractor? According to the IRS, somebody is an independent contractor when the firm paying for his or her work has direct control over the result of the work provided, not over what work will be done and how it will be done. True independent contractors, such as realtors and freelance graphic designers (to give just two typical examples), are self-employed and responsible for finding clients on their own. One could say the definition actually excludes a lot of today&rsquo;s supposedly independent workers&hellip;</p><p>The new working class finds other particular challenges to organise in that the working conditions are so disparate and sometimes so extreme that they make organisation nearly impossible. According to the <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.epi.org/\">Economic Policy Institute</a>, 17% of the workforce has an unstable work schedule, which wreaks havoc on their lives and their budgets. These schedules are a major subject for movements like Fight For $15. Starbucks baristas forced into &lsquo;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2014/08/19/starbucks-clopening-practices-deemed-inexcusable/#539100b856c6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/retailwire/2014/08/19/starbucks-clopening-practices-deemed-inexcusable/#539100b856c6\"><em>clopening</em></a>&rsquo; need more than a raise.</p><p>Last but not least, worker power is all the weaker when there are more actors to negotiate with. The franchise model that concerns a large number of low-paid workers is making things worse: &ldquo;<em>the franchise model has devolved into a tale of big brands squeezing more profits from their franchisees under draconian operating procedures, with franchisees in turn squeezing out their profits by cheating workers out of pay.</em>&rdquo; (<em>Sleeping Giant</em>)</p><h4>Going digital: the new ways of organising</h4><p>Itis not easy to reach janitors who work nights, home workers who drive alone and virtual workers who never leave home. Top-down doesn&rsquo;t work. The more disparate the group, the more tricky it is to foster solidarity. The more unequal and unevenly distributed the work schedules, the harder it is to organise. Starbucks baristas find it hard to make Starbucks end &lsquo;clopening&rsquo; even after <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/starbucks-barista-reveals-what-its-like-to-work-there-2015-9?r=US&amp;IR=T\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/starbucks-barista-reveals-what-its-like-to-work-there-2015-9?r=US&amp;IR=T\">raising a lot of awareness</a> on the issue. Though clearly raising awareness is a good start.</p><p>Tech is helpful when atomised workers start to effectively use tools that allow them to connect and compare notes. &ldquo;<em>When couriers for the UberEats food delivery service went on wildcat strikes this summer, they communicated and co-ordinated through a private instant message group they all accessed on their phones</em>&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/562f7ede-c119-11e6-81c2-f57d90f6741a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/562f7ede-c119-11e6-81c2-f57d90f6741a\">Financial Times</a>). Many activists are only now exploring how best to deploy tech to help them win their battles. And there are abundant tools to achieve that. (See O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s report on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/serving-workers-in-the-gig-economy-report\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/serving-workers-in-the-gig-economy-report\"><em>Serving Workers in the Gig Economy</em></a><em>.</em>)</p><p>Some movements like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Opportunities_Center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant_Opportunities_Center\">ROC United</a> have found new ways to raise awareness. With social media, they have reached their goals faster and more effectively than a traditional union would have in this case. These movement are not unions, they are modern-day lobbying organisations that rely on a new alliance between employees and customers.</p><p>Organising today doesn&rsquo;t mean quite the same as organising yesterday. It may now mean different things, like raising awareness and creating an alliance with the customers, as ROC United successfully managed to do (watch the video above!). The very definition of a union is being revisited: strictly speaking, the Freelancers Union is not really a union, yet it has been influential in changing the fate of all independent workers, raising awareness, offering adequate insurance, <em>etc.</em></p><p>In the UK, a small union, the Independent Workers&rsquo; Union of Great Britain (IWGB) represents low-paid migrants and workers in the &lsquo;gig economy&rsquo;. It has enrolled many new members and risen awareness. It relies on crowdfunding to help finance its initiatives. Today it is fighting to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/06/holidays-equal-pay-brexit-rights-union-iwgb?CMP=share_btn_fb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/06/holidays-equal-pay-brexit-rights-union-iwgb?CMP=share_btn_fb\">make sure Brexit will not</a> deprive these workers of all their rights (EU law meant more protection).</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The digital-age working class in reinventing worker organisation, particularly in the US.

        "content": "<p> </p><p>MAY 2016 &ndash; The Harvard Business Review &ndash; Justin Talbot-Zorn and Frieda Edgette</p><p> </p><p>Over the course of a couple of decades, meditation has migrated from Himalayan hilltops and Japanese Zendos to corporate boardrooms and corridors of power, including Google, Apple, Aetna, the Pentagon, and the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><p>On a personal level, leaders are taking note of empirical research documenting meditation&rsquo;s potential for reducing stress, lowering blood pressure, and improving emotional regulation. Mindfulness meditation &mdash; the practice of cultivating deliberate focused attention on the present moment &ndash; has caught on as a way to bring focus, authenticity, and intention to the practice of leadership. Harvard Business Review contributors Daniel Goleman and Bill George have described mindfulness as a means to listen more deeply and guide actions through clear intention rather than emotional whims or reactive patterns.</p><p>In an age in which corporations and public organizations are increasingly under attack for short-term thinking, a dearth of vision, and perfunctory reactions to quick stimuli, it&rsquo;s worth posing the question: Can mindfulness help organizations &mdash; not just individual leaders &mdash; behave more intentionally? Practically speaking, can organizational leaders integrate mindfulness practices into strategic planning processes.</p><p>Seventy years ago, Viktor Frankl, an Austrian psychiatrist who had just emerged from years as a prisoner at Auschwitz, shed some light on the question with a now-classic teaching. &ldquo;Between stimulus and response, there is a space,&rdquo; he wrote in 1946. &ldquo;In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.&rdquo;</p><p>Mindfulness &mdash; the practice of watching one&rsquo;s breath and noticing thoughts and sensations &mdash; is, at its core, a practice of cultivating this kind of space. It&rsquo;s about becoming aware of how the diverse internal and external stimuli we face can provoke automatic, immediate, unthinking responses in our thoughts, emotions, and actions. As the University of Virginia&rsquo;s Timothy Wilson has argued, our brains are not equipped to handle the 11-plus million bits of information arriving at any given moment. For the sake of efficiency, we tend to make new decisions based upon old frames, memories, or associations. Through mindfulness practice, a person is able to notice how the mind reacts to thoughts, sensations, and information, seeing past the old storylines and habitual patterns that unconsciously guide behavior. This creates space to deliberately choose how to speak and act.</p><p>Organizations, like individuals, need this kind of space.</p><p>As UCLA&rsquo;s Richard Rumelt, a leading expert on strategic planning, writes in his book <em>Good Strategy, Bad Strategy</em>, one of the quintessential components of good strategy is the ability to take a step out of the internal storyline and shift viewpoints. &ldquo;An insightful reframing of a competitive situation&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;can create whole new patterns of advantage and weakness. The most powerful strategies arise from such game-changing insights.&rdquo;</p><p>To craft strategy on the basis of what Harvard&rsquo;s Richard Chait and other scholars have called generative thinking, it&rsquo;s not only necessary to identify a coherent set of policies or actions in response to a problem or opportunity, it&rsquo;s also necessary to elucidate the full range of values, assumptions, and external factors at play in a decision-making situation. It&rsquo;s essential to step back and ask not only whether the team has identified the right plans or solutions but whether they have identified the right questions and problems in the first place. All this requires space between stimulus and response.</p><p>So how can organizations bring more space to strategic planning? Is the answer to simply recruit leaders and board members who engage in contemplative practices?</p><p>It can&rsquo;t hurt. Steve Jobs, a regular meditator, made use of mindfulness practice to challenge operating assumptions at Apple and to enhance creative insight in planning. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Capital has likewise used mindfulness not only as a tool for increasing productivity but also enhancing situational awareness as a strategist.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s also possible to build mindfulness directly into planning exercises.</p><p>One of us recently had the opportunity to test the concept of mindful strategy with a group of middle managers and senior executives from the legal, advertising, finance, and non-profit sectors in the Bay Area. The experience gave us a clearer practical understanding of what works when it comes to integrating mindfulness practice into strategy retreats.</p><p><strong>Take mindful moments: </strong>One simple approach is to integrate straightforward mindfulness activities into meetings and retreats. By punctuating planning exercises with deliberate time for those present to simply connect with their breath and recognize unnecessary distractions, organizers can create the conditions for intuition to arise. As Rasmus Hougaard and Jacqueline Carter wrote in HBR in March, it&rsquo;s possible to integrate simple practices of focus and awareness throughout a workday. Google&rsquo;s Chade-Meng Tan, has developed dozens of such workplace meditation modules that could fit neatly into planning retreats.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Explore alternative scenarios: </strong>It&rsquo;s also possible to inject an element of mindfulness without meditating at all. Scenario planning exercises, for example, open decision-makers to numerous, plausible alternative &ldquo;stories of the future&rdquo; that inherently challenge assumptions and mindsets. Corporations including Shell and governments including Singapore have used such practices &mdash; first and foremost for their heuristic value &mdash; with considerable success for decades. Much like meditation, the practice of <em>nonjudgmentally</em> assessing different plausible futures is a practical way of shining light on old unexamined thought patterns and making room for new ideas.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Visualize positive outcomes</strong>: As Daniel Goleman argues, positivity is part and parcel of focused attention. &ldquo;Pessimism narrows our focus,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;whereas positive emotions widen our attention and our receptiveness to the new and unexpected.&rdquo; Organizational leaders can benefit from imagining organizational &ldquo;end-states&rdquo; during strategy sessions. This can be as simple as posing a variant of the question Goleman suggests&mdash; &ldquo;if everything works out perfectly for our organization, what would we be doing in ten years?&rdquo;&mdash;and taking time to contemplate.</p><p> </p><p>Mindfulness practices like these can help leaders &mdash; and their organizations &mdash; identify which ideas and aspirations are important and which assumptions limit their growth. They&rsquo;re useful not only for attaining enlightenment but also for making sense of a changing world.</p>",

        "content": "<p> </p><p>Harvard Business Review &ndash; Jocelyn R. Davis and Tom Atkinson</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>In business, there&rsquo;s a speed gap: It&rsquo;s the difference between how important a firm&rsquo;s leaders say speed is to their competitive strategy and how fast the company actually moves. That gap is significant regardless of region, industry, company size, or strategic emphasis. Organizations fearful of losing their competitive advantage spend much time and many resources looking for ways to pick up the pace.</p><p>Paradoxically, they should try slowing down instead. In our study of 343 businesses (conducted with the Economist Intelligence Unit), the companies that embraced initiatives and chose to go, go, go to try to gain an edge ended up with lower sales and operating profits than those that paused at key moments to make sure they were on the right track. What&rsquo;s more, the firms that &ldquo;slowed down to speed up&rdquo; improved their top and bottom lines, averaging 40% higher sales and 52% higher operating profits over a three-year period.</p><p>How did they defy the laws of business physics, taking more time than competitors yet performing better? They thought differently about what &ldquo;slower&rdquo; and &ldquo;faster&rdquo; mean. Firms sometimes confuse operational speed (moving quickly) with strategic speed (reducing the time it takes to deliver value)&mdash;and the two concepts are quite different. Simply increasing the pace of production, for example, may be one way to try to close the speed gap. But that often leads to decreased value over time, in the form of lower-quality products and services. Likewise, new initiatives that move fast may not deliver any value if time isn&rsquo;t taken to identify and adjust the true value proposition.</p><p>In our study, higher-performing companies with strategic speed made alignment a priority. They became more open to ideas and discussion. They encouraged innovative thinking. And they allowed time to reflect and learn. By contrast, performance suffered at firms that moved fast all the time, focused too much on maximizing efficiency, stuck to tested methods, didn&rsquo;t foster employee collaboration, and weren&rsquo;t overly concerned about alignment.</p><p><img src=\"https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/hbr/1005/F1005E_A.gif\" alt=\"\" /></p><div><div><div><p> </p><p> </p><div><p>Strategically Fast Companies Vs.

As advisor, she works with lot of Companies to define or reshape living or work area.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>H</strong><strong>ow did you become a Feng Shui Consultant ?</strong></p><p>As a consequence of my scientific training I worked for a while in a Brazilian company which was in charge of Amazonian plants research for laboratories like Boiron, when I met someone who was beginning a Feng Shui training. The love at first sight with this discipline was immediate, and I started my own training few years later in Malaysia at Lillian Too Institute in 2001.</p><p>In 2002, I settled myself as a Feng Shui consultant and instructor, in a time where this field was not quite known in Europe. I was lucky, in 2005, to receive a request from Trajectoire editions to write a book about Feng Shui (Live your Feng Shui daily).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How would you defined Feng Shui ?</strong></p><p>Plurimilennium discipline (nearly 5000 years) rooted in Chinese wisdom, proposing a layout for living and work areas, in a way to improve your well-being through a well circulation of energies. We use the decoration (color, material, forms, painting, representations) to lead energies in spaces, in the way we want.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you often work with companies for work layout ?</strong></p><p>No, very few, on one side because I do more training than consultations, but on the other hand also because companies are slightly less sensitized to employees well-being (even though things begin to change seriously, but for my part I dedicate myself more and more to the training).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you have examples of your interventions in professional environment ?</strong></p><p>Few small personal companies, of small dimension, mainly merchant (optician ETC). Charles de Gaulle airport asked for an English Feng Shui consultant to build the G terminal. Sofitel use also the Feng Shui for some of its hotels. It is a trend which getting more and more widespread.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>As a Feng Shui consultant, what is the well-being at work according to you ?</strong></p><p>It is to balance less stress and motivation to work. In Feng Shui, we will play on colors, materials, workstations&#8217; orientations, on the improvement of the circulation in the open space (and working on restricting noise / olfactory nuisances, on the fact that many people are circulating behind the employee, increasing his stress, ect.).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Which advices would give for a Feng Shui office ?</strong></p><p>It is hard to give &#8220;preconceived&#8221; advices because each office is different. But we will try to balance bright colors and gentle ones, to encourage tranquility without &#8220;sedating&#8221; the employees. We will do the same with materials, soft or smooth, bright or uneven&#8230; we will employ enough plants to create a thriving energy, as well as joyful and cheerful representations. We will avoid the employees to stand back on the rest of the space, and mainly if people are walking behind (creating a huge feeling of unsafety).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>According to you, what impacted this awareness of the work environment ?</strong></p><p>For me, just the raise of burn out ! We clearly see that we are arriving at the end of a system where the single research to profits does not work. And the awareness is linked to a rise of the personal development.</p>",

        "content": "<p><em>Barbara Meyer worked in crisis communication and sports coaching. She is animated by the desire to understand motivation, performance and stress management. She is now coach in benevolent performance, author and speaker based in San Francisco. Specialist of burnout prevention and fatigue management, she combines physical and mental preparation to personal development. </em><em>She is the author of several books published by Eyrolles including 21 jours pour arr&ecirc;ter d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre d&eacute;bord&eacute;e (&ldquo; 21 days to stop being swamped &rdquo;).</em></p><p> </p><p><strong>Dear Barbara could you please shortly sum-up your professional background ?</strong></p><p> </p><p>I worked almost ten years in crisis communication for several firms. Firstly, for Areva and then for a PR Agency specialized in crisis communication management. During this second period, I worked for Tunnel du Mont Blanc, SITA or INPES. One day I realized that sport was missing me, so I went back to University to be graduated in Sport and Mental Preparation. It helped me to understand how athletes can stay calm and focus on their role, always motivated while Managers in firms could not ! Then I worked ten years in coaching mixing my competencies in crisis management and sport attitudes. During these last ten years, I had learned from my clients how stress can impact their bodies and mental and I&rsquo;ve written 4 books on how to be more efficient and happy in your personal and professional life using mental and physical techniques.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why sport is so important in your life and career ? And why it takes place as a main driver for your life switching ?</strong></p><p> </p><p>My father was a biker and a huge fan of soccer. During my childhood, I always practiced swimming, athleticism, and skiing because I was living closed to the mountains ! Sports was also a way to be outside. I always enjoyed the challenge, competitive spirit and being able to surpass myself. When I had my first job in Paris, and perhaps also because my first job was very stressful and not fun at all, I played sport, just to manage myself, my stress and my efficiency. Life is a marathon and there is a lot of connections between athletics methods and management. You know, athletes are focus on the way they are going to perform. They keep attention on what they are doing in each training, and they are not losing time thinking what they could do with a gold metal around their neck. I saw too much managers or people who made lots of mistakes by setting wrong goals that means wrong motivation, too many wrong decisions made under stress in several companies.</p><p> </p><p><strong>It seems that you&rsquo;ve been driven by your family background of excellence; failing was not an option and overpass oneself was the main driver of your father; it is a strong part of competitive mindset to practice sport. Do you think that, to preserve yourself, you need to get out of that ?</strong></p><p> </p><p>I was driven by &ldquo;do not fail&rdquo; but also by &ldquo;anything you can do, do it by yourself&rdquo;. Be independent and do not ask others. It had a double impact in my life. When I worked for the PR Agency, I&rsquo;ve never asked some help because this was not my education (and not a skill of mine) and this was not the Agency&rsquo;s culture. I remembered being often exhausted. During ski holidays, I had a ski accident. It was not the first time but one of the most serious : I broke a vertebra and brushed the paralysis. I started to realize that my body had some limits I never imagined before. This was a turning point. I identified my body limits, and realized that without my body I could not do anything. It made me realized one thing : if my body failed, my mind failed too. I lost motivation, and each difficulty became an insurmountable mountain ! In fact, I was understanding the link between body and mind against my previous beliefs in &ldquo;I want, so I do&rdquo;.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Is your communication skill an asset for being a better coach ?</strong></p><p> </p><p>Yes absolutely. I am conducting media training, so communication skills are an asset for my coaching. It is truly important to identify the right moment when your client does not understand something. So, from my previous experiences, specifically in communication, I learnt that listening was a key asset. My age is a second one. Young, you are going to school to have a job. When it is a retraining, you are going to school to live a passion through a job. Your learning is more efficient and intense. When I went back to the University, at 30 years old, it meant sacrifices ! I was more concentrated and perhaps I learned deeper than young students (20 years old in average). But I was happy to live this experience far away from stress and despite the age difference, because we formed a great and strong team. Huge experience ! It showed me that every training, or every work, is easier and more pleasant with team spirit and &ldquo;help each other&rdquo; mindset. The third asset is coming from my business experience. I have a great comprehension of stress (because I experimented it) and I know the challenges imposed by Companies : productivity, time managing, objectives not adapted, management. Last but not least, I get through a burn out. Unfortunately, I experimented a mental fatigue, you know when you cannot think, you cannot react or do anything because you are over thinking or under thinking. You need to do something for yourself, to take care of yourself. During this period, I experimented on myself a method. And it worked ! So, I wrote a book to share this method. The principle could be sum-up in &ldquo;what you are doing for yourself today&rdquo;. The idea is to take time for yourself, it is not wasting time, it is about being strong and helping others. Take time to learn from yourself and others. The key point could be &ldquo;be kind with yourself before it&rsquo;s too late&rdquo; !</p><p> </p><p><strong>One of your book titled is &ldquo;I quit being overwhelmed&rdquo;. What motivated you in writing book ? </strong></p><p> </p><p>&ldquo;I quit being overwhelmed&rdquo; was the experience of my personal life. How do you accept and manage the challenge of your life ? At the beginning of an adult life, it is simple. But, like a snowball, little by little it becomes more and more difficult. You add different issues and at a certain point it is a big deal (job, responsibilities, relationship, children&hellip;). How could you learn to be a snowboarder without falling ? Or how could you run a marathon without preparation ? It is not a question of being organized, but of being aware of what happen to you. To develop mindfulness and to be conscious of what is important for you. The idea is stop doing things just by routine. A good starting point is perhaps just being clear with what is important in your life, included all people around you. Do not try to be the fifth wheels, it is not a real place and could be toxic. It is better to be the four-wheeled vehicle.</p><p><img src=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/livreBarbaraMeyer_photo-300x200.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/livreBarbaraMeyer_photo-300x200.png 300w, http://consultants.wantmore.work/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/livreBarbaraMeyer_photo.png 640w\" alt=\"livreBarbaraMeyer_photo\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></p><p>I wrote a second opus dealing with this theme but goes deeper on the concept of being benevolent with yourself and with people you love. It looks like a family team game. The first family team building game ! I am very proud of this game and my children love it because it gives, to a family, the opportunity to express kindness. During one week, you play with cards. Each one can get a benevolent or a solidarity action for himself or for someone else in the family. It is a day to day family run involving all the family players with love spirit and fun. The feedbacks are very good : children love to play; it is really funny with joker cards and family challenges. From the moment you take care of yourself, you start to be more efficient. That is the purpose of my last book. &ldquo;Stop to be couch potato&rdquo;. My message is focus on the importance to take time to breath and be oneself, to re-focus on our body, to listen to our own sensations, desires, needs, &hellip; and be ready to set right objectives. Those you can reach, to live the life you expected. It is a 21 days program to improve yourself, to accept the challenge to be trained like an athlete and start to optimize your strengths and be performant. 21 days is an average duration to adapt your brain. The program could be declined to anyone. It begins with a morning routine, because it is the best moment to have enough time for exercises, to prepare yourself for the rest of the day. You never know what could happen in your day. The target is to be prepared for anything. During 21 days you will practice one physical exercise by day and you will challenge your mental with an exercise that will help you to think outside the box. I linked mental and physical challenges because every movement you are doing in your daily life has a mental goal. When you raise your hand, it is not just a movement but also the expression of being, participating, being seen in a group. So, it is important to link each movement with a mental challenge. That is why when you foresee your day, open your hands to welcome the day. It resonates with an opening aura on the morning.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Well, if I understand correctly, you seem to say that doing the less could be better, isn&rsquo;t it in opposition with work life ? I mean with digital development ? </strong></p><p> </p><p>I think multitasking is killing productivity. You are less concentrated and so less efficient, and at the end you lose in productivity. From my point of view, and observations of my clients, it generates mistakes, and mistakes imply stress, waste of time, loss of self -confidence and so on&hellip; that is how the vicious circle is beginning. By running after time you multiply multitasking and you are always missing something. For instance, when you make a cake, the phone always rings. It is not a big deal, so you take the call and guess what ? Because you are talking in the phone you are not focusing on your preparation and forget the sugar. It is just an example to show the limits of over connections. Why does it generate stress ? Not for the cake but in life and specially in work life, because you are downsized in a society of excellence. You underperform ! So, you judge yourself with severity, forgetting the context and deeper than reality. This is the gate to begin a burn out. You are running to look for repairing mistakes, you are losing time and little by little, you are disconnecting yourself from your role and your personal motivations. It is a self-confidence burning process. Why young generations or native ones are more familiar with multitasking ? It is a question of habits: since their childhood, they accurate them to multi devices, jumping from one to another. Oldest generations did not listen to music, check Facebook or Snapchat, while they were doing their homework.</p><p> </p><p><strong>You say that people spend 80% of their time to do 20% of their work. You propose to inverse numbers, but how ?</strong></p><p> </p><p>Simply by being focused on what you are doing. The key point is to know what you have to do very clearly and set your goals precisely. After that, it&rsquo;s easier to stay focused on what you have to do. The best way to succeed is to visualize your day, even if we know unexpected things happen and take you away from your goals. By visualizing your day, it is easier to run your day. I am not fond of having a A list or B list, I prefer the idea of knowing what you have to do (the holistic approach). You know when you forget to do something, you have two options: 1. it is a sign that you are tired, then it is time to make a pause like an athlete who is taking time to recover or 2. perhaps it was not important, so let it go. Imagine a slalom-man (skiing) in a race, before to start, he visualizes the run, each gate after each gate. He does not visualize him on the podium, but he visualizes the race, step by step. It is exactly the same for us. Each morning, visualize what will be important and how the day will be organized. Trust your mind and be confident. When your mind is clear, you can organize ideas and classify the different tasks by priorities.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Can you be firm and open to yourself at the same time ? I mean soft with yourself ? </strong></p><p> </p><p>It is a question of what you like for you. What do you want for you ? And what do you want to show ? To be firm offers you the abilities to stand up straight, so to stand like someone who is proud of himself, and ready for new challenges. It offers you enough strength to carry on new projects. Be firm is also be rigorous and respect yourself, at least enough to workout. Stand far away from pain (back pain, neck pain, &hellip;) that kill your concentration, your efficiency, and your mood. Take time to listen to yourself, you will gain in creativity and efficiency. Set-up routines (and firm is process) to impact your physical and mental well-being, your productivity and avoid mental fatigue.</p>",

She continues her studies at Sciences Po Paris where she follows a specialisation on the Middle-East and Mediterranean area.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>MARCH 2017 &ndash; Johanne Fora&ndash;Porthault</p><p> </p><p><strong>Cultures in business: clash or asset?</strong></p><p>In our globalized world, it won&rsquo;t surprise anyone that cultures are in interaction. But we usually think that as long as we&rsquo;re doing business together, our partners&rsquo; culture doesn&rsquo;t matter. As if one global identity would exist when we&rsquo;re doing business. But that is wrong. Business interactions are nowadays deeply marked by cultures, and this in every single field. And so the question is: is this for clash or asset?</p><p> </p><p>Culture is different in each country, each person gets a different style of communication, a different respect in schedule or in the formalities, or even in the familial priorities. And so, we need to adjust ourselves, but who has to adapt himself to whom? And how?</p><p> </p><p>A mutual comprehension and a fruitful collaboration seem difficult, all the more with language barriers. For example, if you want to understand if the person in front of you disagrees or not, your perception will be different according to your interlocutor&rsquo;s culture: an American will mostly coat negative messages by positive ones, whereas a French will be direct risking to be rude and demotivating while a Japanese will prefer the diplomacy to the confrontation. If you are not aware of those differences, the understanding can be complicated&hellip;</p><p>The same trouble is existing for other domains. The hierarchic relation is really important in Asia while in the USA and in Scandinavia authority will take a different form. And, in some countries you will find another time relation: some will prefer a short time vision, focusing on three-month deadline (mostly in the west), and some will prefer a long time vision.</p><p> </p><p>So how is it supposed to work?</p><ul><li>Do not be late if you have a meeting with German people, they are attached to punctuality and thoroughness.</li><li>Be prepared to be direct and to work in a virtual space with colleagues from all over the States if you are dealing with Americans.</li><li>And do not be afraid of the noise if you are trading with Indians, they feed themselves in the effervescence. They are also quite friendly so do not be too shy, they like to share and exchange, taking care of the harmony.</li></ul><p>And the list goes on and on&hellip;</p><p>But say like this &ndash; or rather list like this &ndash; a huge and exhaustive guide seems useful if we want to understand our partners and clients from all over the world&hellip; It seems easier to throw in the towel in developing a cross cultural business, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>However if cultural differences complicate relations and business in general, your knowledge of those cultural differences can though lead you to profits and a gain in competitive advantage.</p><p> </p><p>Culture impacts a lot of things &ndash; if it is not everything &ndash; and in business, this can be translated in the relations with clients, suppliers and partners, in the marketing and in the merchandizing, and so on. If you welcome your Asian partner by tilting your head, the contract is not done, but you have certainly marked few points. If you use purple in a product intended for Brazil or Thailand, you have to be aware that this color represents mourning and maybe you made a mistake&hellip; On the contrary, if you know how to use the symbols&rsquo; signification in each country for your advertisement, you can gain a lot. And this scheme is the same for every domain in business!</p><p> </p><p>Besides, a multicultural team can really be an asset for your company. Nowadays, to mention only one example, the innovation seems blocked. The engineers&rsquo; profile looks always the same in that department: quite uniform, they usually have the same background and the same formation. A multicultural approach of the innovation is a key to revive it because a cross-cultural team will tackle the issues with a different point of view, thanks to its cross-cultural perception.</p><p> </p><p>Another positive point in understanding the cultures for your business can be directly found in the selling. If you want to make supply and demand meet, you have to understand your clients&rsquo; culture &ndash; as your suppliers&rsquo; culture. You won&rsquo;t be able to make business in different country using the same design, the same marketing or even the same merchandising&hellip; Let&rsquo;s have a look on Etam example. The French brand is located in many different countries such as South Korea, Armenia, Saudi Arabia, ect. And always adapts itself to the targeted country: in China each garment is adjusted to the local preferences, and even to the local shapes.</p><p>It is the whole difference between a global business and a globalized business: you don&rsquo;t integrate yourself to the market, you adapt yourself to the market &ndash; at least, if you want to succeed. You will be better in adopting an intercultural approach rather than a transcultural one&hellip;</p><p> </p><p>You also have the question of the Digital. Digital draws a new area where you can find new development perspectives beyond our usual environments. And here again, a good understanding of cultures is an asset.</p><p>Firstly because Digital opens direct interaction zones with the clients and a new marketing territory. This territory is getting bigger thanks to digital but so the communication has to be more sharpened to seduce a savvier and more exigent customer: using a comprehension of cultures allows companies to sharpen their projects&rsquo; relevance and their client relationship (by personalizing them). It lets companies creating a new social cohesion around themselves and their brand.</p><p>Digital opens a collaborative world as well, triggering off an industrial and sectorial departitioning. In this speeder wider world, companies have so to know how to adapt themselves, to understand and to innovate, which is not possible if you don&rsquo;t adopt a cross-culture approach. But Digital proposes a solution to this: it permits to go beyond territorial and cultural borders thanks to a recruitment departitioning for instance. Digital encourages diversity, you just have to use it !</p><p>Lastly, this step towards cross cultural business is a step towards a more humanist business which takes the other in consideration fully and with his cultural particularities.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Business is not only about making profits and creating a unique product, but business is about understanding the other, to target his/her desires and expectations. And nowadays, in our globalized world, cross culture control is the key to a successful worldwide business. So be curious!</p><p> </p>",

Business interactions are nowadays deeply marked by cultures, and this in every single field. And so the question is: is this for clash or asset...?",

        "content": "<p>SEPTEMBER 2016 &#8211; The Harvard Business Review &#8211; David Rock, Heidi Grant and Jacqui Grey</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In numerous studies, diversity — both inherent (e.g., race, gender) and acquired (experience, cultural background) — is associated with business success. For example, a 2009 analysis of 506 companies found that firms with more racial or gender diversity had more sales revenue, more customers, and greater profits. A 2016 analysis of more than 20,000 firms in 91 countries found that companies with more female executives were more profitable. In a 2011 study management teams exhibiting a wider range of educational and work backgrounds produced more-innovative products. These are mere correlations, but laboratory experiments have also shown the direct effect of diversity on team performance. In a 2006 study of mock juries, for example, when black people were added to the jury, white jurors processed the case facts more carefully and deliberated more effectively.</p><p>Under increasing scrutiny, and mindful of the benefits of diversity on the bottom line, many companies are trying to recruit and retain a more diverse workforce. Success has so far been marginal. With so much at stake, why aren’t these companies making more headway? One reason could be that, despite the evidence about their results, homogenous teams just <em>feel</em> more effective. In addition, people believe that diverse teams breed greater conflict than they actually do. Bringing these biases to light may enable ways to combat them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Homogenous Teams Feel Easier — but Easy Is Bad for Performance</strong></p><p>A revealing 2009 study of fraternity and sorority members published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin offers a remarkable window into the workings of diverse and homogenous teams. Fraternity and sorority membership conveys a powerful group identity, much like political or religious affiliation, and consequently can create a strong sense of similarity (or dissimilarity) with others. In the experiment, teams were asked to solve a murder mystery. First, students were individually given 20 minutes to study the clues and pinpoint the likely suspect. Next, they were placed into teams of three with fellow members from the same Greek house and given 20 minutes to discuss the case together and provide a joint answer. Five minutes into the discussion, however, they were joined by a fourth team member, someone from either their own house or another one.</p><p>After collectively naming their suspect, members individually rated aspects of the discussion. More diverse groups — those joined by someone from outside their own fraternity or sorority — judged the team interactions to be less effective than did groups joined by insiders. They were also less confident in their final decisions.</p><p>Intuitively, this makes sense: On a homogenous team, people readily understand each other and collaboration flows smoothly, giving the sensation of progress. Dealing with outsiders causes friction, which feels counterproductive.</p><p>But in this case their judgments were starkly wrong. Among groups where all three original members didn’t already know the correct answer, adding an outsider versus an insider actually doubled their chance of arriving at the correct solution, from 29% to 60%. The work felt harder, but the outcomes were better.</p><p>In fact, working on diverse teams produces better outcomes precisely <em>because</em> it’s harder.</p><p>This idea goes against many people’s intuitions. There’s a common bias that psychologists call the fluency heuristic: We prefer information that is processed more easily, or fluently, judging it to be truer or more beautiful. The effect partially explains that we gain greater appreciation of songs or paintings when they become familiar because they’re more easily processed. The fluency heuristic leads many people to study incorrectly; they often simply reread the material. The information becomes more familiar without much effort, and so they feel that they’re learning. But in a 2011 study students performed better on a test after studying the text once and then trying to recall as much as they could, a strenuous task, than they did by repeatedly going over the text, even though they predicted that rereading was the key to learning. Similarly, confronting opinions you disagree with might not seem like the quickest path to getting things done, but working in groups can be like studying (or exercising): no pain, no gain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Diversity Can Increase Conflict, but Not as Much as You Think</strong></p><p>There’s another bias at play here, too: A 2015 paper in Organization Science, summarized in this HBR article, suggests that people overestimate the amount of conflict that actually exists on diverse teams. In one study MBA students were asked to imagine that they were comanaging several four-person teams of interns, and that one team had asked for additional resources. They saw photos of the members, depicting four white men, four black men, or two of each. They then read a transcript of a discussion among the group and rated the team on various factors. Teams of four white men and four black men were seen as having equal levels of relationship conflict, but the diverse teams were seen as having more relationship conflict than the homogeneous teams, even though everyone had read the same transcript. Further, this perception of greater conflict made the participants less likely to provide the additional resources the mixed group had requested.</p><p>This type of unconscious bias can clearly have a significant impact not only on hiring but also on the ways in which leaders create teams and encourage collaboration.  Without realizing it, they may be reluctant to add diversity to a team or to assign colleagues with different backgrounds to work together, in response to an (overblown) fear of the tension and difficulty that could ensue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Capitalizing on Diversity Means Highlighting — Not Hiding from — Differences</strong></p><p>It’s critical to note that simply making a team more diverse is not necessarily enough to see the benefits. Diverse teams must find ways to work together productively, and often the best ways of working may seem counterintuitive.</p><p>For example, research suggests that when people with different perspectives are brought together, people may seek to gloss over those differences in the interest of group harmony — when, in fact, differences should actually be taken seriously and highlighted. In a 2012 study teams of three were tasked with generating a creative business plan for a theater. On some teams, members were assigned distinct roles (Artistic, Event, and Finance Manager), thus increasing diversity of viewpoints. These teams came up with better ideas than homogeneous teams — but only if they’d been explicitly told to try to take the perspectives of their teammates. They had to face up to their differences in order to benefit from them.</p><p>Another way to take advantage of differing viewpoints is to highlight the value of multiculturalism. One 2009 study looked at support for multiculturalism versus colorblindness in nearly 4,000 employees in 18 work units at a large U.S. health care firm. The more that workers agreed that “employees should recognize and celebrate racial and ethnic differences” and the more they disagreed that “employees should downplay their racial and ethnic differences,” the more that minorities in those units reported feeling engaged in their work. In another 2009 study, pairs of students, one white and one Aboriginal Canadian, were teamed up for a conversation. Prefacing the meeting with a message supporting multiculturalism (versus no message) made the meeting more positive, while a message endorsing colorblindness led whites to turn negative toward their minority partners.</p><p>Of course, diversity is not always a panacea, and it can at times produce corrosive conflict. When that happens, it is often because team members are bringing different values, rather than different ideas, to the table. It’s difficult to overcome differences in values, no matter how well-intentioned colleagues may be. In addition, diversity’s benefits are rarely obtained without a strong sense of team and organizational inclusion. Only when people feel welcome and respected will the team be able to benefit from their unique perspective and experience.</p><p>The research presented here suggests that diversity initiatives may not be successful until we do more to address the way diversity is perceived. When leaders see it first and foremost as a social obligation that makes things difficult and slows progress, they will likely make decisions that undermine the organization’s diversity goals. They may also, at least unconsciously, try to downplay the substance of existing diversity on their teams. If, however, leaders can recognize that the debate and unfamiliarity that come with diversity is an important catalyst for creativity and deep thinking, they will invite it and celebrate it. And very likely, the organization — and everyone in it — will reap the rewards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "content": "<p>JULY 2016 &#8211; The Harvard Business Review &#8211; Roger Schwarz</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The term “organizational culture” can obscure an important truth: An organization often contains many cultures. This is true even if your organization is located entirely in one country, or even at one site.</p><p>Because each business unit or team may have their own subculture, working effectively across the organization requires skill in working across cultures.</p><p>Doing this requires three steps: understanding what culture is and how it works, identifying the cultures of your team and the teams you work with, and designing how you and the other teams will work together.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Understand what team culture is and how it works.</strong> A team’s culture is its shared values and assumptions, and it results from a mix of elements :  the organization, industry, geographic region and nation, and profession or function the team represents. Values are things we consider worth striving for, such as honesty, accountability, and compassion. Assumptions are beliefs we hold about how the world works or how things are related. For example, you may assume that people generally want to do a good job, or that people are more committed to a decision when they are involved in making it. A team manifests its culture in many artifacts, including norms that lead members to act in certain ways and to create structures, processes, and policies. It’s important to distinguish between a team’s espoused culture and the one it operates from. The values that team members <em>say</em> they operate from are the espoused culture — which may or may not be what they actually operate from.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Identify your team’s and other teams’ cultures.</strong> To determine how cultures differ, you need to identify the values and assumptions that constitute them. And to do that you need to operate from the assumption that differences are opportunities for learning;  if that thinking isn’t already part of your culture, your joint exploration may quickly devolve into conflict as each team describes how the other’s culture is a problem. To avoid this, consider finding a facilitator or consultant to help you.</p><p>Start by identifying artifacts that strike each team as notably different from its own. This includes norms, behaviors, structures, and processes. For example, you may notice that the team you’re working with spends significant time trying to agree on what important words mean, while your team considers these detailed conversations to be a poor use of time. Or the other team may point out that your team deals with inter-team conflicts by raising the issue in the full inter-team meeting, while their team discusses conflicts in private.</p><p>Next, identify the assumptions and values that generate these artifacts. In the example above, your team raising conflicts in the full group may reflect your belief that conflict can best be resolved in the setting where all the information exists. The other team may assume that conflicts are best resolved in private where people are less likely to become embarrassed or defensive. I have found that organizational function is a significant part of team norms. Professions such as engineering and medicine, which are rooted in the scientific method, may value precision and logical reasoning more than other functions, for instance. To perform this step well, it’s critical that you get curious about the other team’s values and assumptions, instead of assuming you know the values or assumptions that explain the artifact. You can infer a team’s culture from its artifacts, but you can’t figure out whether your inference is correct without asking the team’s members.</p><p>Finally, determine whether each artifact is shared, different but congruent, or conflicting. Conflicting artifacts are the most important to address because they present the greatest challenge to working together effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jointly design a solution for the different and conflicting values and assumptions. </strong>Focusing on the values and assumptions rather than on the artifacts is important both because it helps everyone understand the reasons behind each team’s artifacts and because it helps you design solutions for norms, structures, and processes that are based on the same values and assumptions.</p><p>There are several options for designing a solution. If one team is particularly bound to its values and assumptions in a certain situation, the other team may decide simply to adopt that team’s approach. For example, the team that discusses conflict privately may begin doing it in meetings if the other team makes a compelling case for it. Or the teams can develop a solution that integrates their cultures when the two are not necessarily incompatible. For example, the teams could agree to initially raise a conflict in private with the person who is most involved in solving it, and then jointly raise the issue with the larger team. Lastly, the teams can compromise when other options don’t work. This may be the best solution you can develop, but because compromises don’t resolve conflicting values and assumptions, they tend to leave everyone somewhat dissatisfied, so they may not create sustainable solutions. For example, the teams might agree to let each member decide on whether to raise a conflict privately or in the team.</p><p>Just as an effective team invests time and effort agreeing on how members will work together, so do teams that work effectively with each other.</p>",

Where are you mainly present in the world ? </strong></p><p>Nexus Groups Operations consist of the Global marketing of agricultural products (organics and conventional) for human and animal consumption. We originate products from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Malaysia, Thailand, USA, India, Pakistan, Peru, among others&hellip; so basically from all over the world !</p><p>Our Offices are located in specific areas and each office targets a precise region of the world. In Miami in Florida the Corporate Office is in charge of the North America and Caribbean Market. In San Salvador in El Salvador, they have to take care of the overseeing of Mexico and Central America while Lima in Peru oversees Peru&rsquo;s Superfood sourcing operations. Lastly, we have London for the Western Europe and Budapest for the East Europe.</p><p> </p><p><strong>As an international company, you have customers from all over the world. Have you ever met difficulties because of cultural differences in each country ? As in the way you have to organize the marketing.</strong></p><p>Yes, we find many cultural differences. For example, it is not the same to work with European customers than with Latin American customers. European customers are more professional. Our strategy is to assign resources that know the culture to quickly overcome those differences. That is why we have so many offices everywhere in the world and specialized on a determined area: to target the needs. Also, we realized that personal contact is important for customers to see that we are real and here to answer their questions.</p><p> </p><p><strong>And how do you adapt your selling and strategy regarding to those differences in the demand in each country ?</strong></p><p>We assign a local trader for each region. Each trader has specific products. For example, it is not the same demand for western Europe and Eastern Europe. We want to make the demand and supply meet, but nowadays it is impossible to achieve if we are not able to understand each one of our customers, partners and suppliers. We think that taking care and being aware of the differences is the only strategy to adopt.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Would you say that in the context of your company it is important to target the demand and be aware of culture variations ? </strong></p><p>Yes, is very important and we try to do it as much as we can. We cannot pretend to propose the same product for all our customers, that would be a nonsense, so we have to adapt ourselves. And being aware of culture variations is a way to established a correct and targeted communication.</p><p> </p><p><strong>About your partners and suppliers, are the difficulties the same ? Because the relationship is different, you have to negotiate, ect.</strong></p><p>With our partners and suppliers it is effectively a complete different strategy. We assign only one department for all purchasing located in Peru. The department is in charge of all the relations with our suppliers. They manage all the information and after being processed and classified, it is sent to the traders.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Would you say that crossing cultural bridges is the key to a worldwide development?</strong></p><p>Yes, nowadays, it is the only way to expand to other markets as each market has its own identity and needs. We cannot think regarding only one culture, we have to be open-minded if we want to achieve a complete and successful worldwide development.</p>",

        "content": "<p><em>After Art studies, Sabine Landolt switched to Marketing. She worked for several famous firms such as Louis Vuitton and Versace thanks to her multicultural education. And she realized that branding was perfect to combine her artistic and marketing skills. She has now created her own company called Dim3 branding and based in New York City.</em></p><p><strong>What was your career? </strong></p><p>My career is intimately linked to what I lived. Born in California, from a Dutch mother and a Swiss-German father, I can speak five languages; the multicultural is in my blood! I didn&rsquo;t even imagine living in the same country all my life. After studying art, I finally worked in marketing thanks to an opportunity. Before going to Italy and then to France, I was in charge of merchandising products for a Swiss-German business. Finally, I came back to United-States, on the East Coast this time. Today, after many years in head-quarters of important businesses, I&rsquo;m working in my own consulting business in New York, created three years ago.</p><p> </p><p><strong>With your different actions, you had to adapt the products to a new market, with its own characteristics. </strong></p><p>Yes, for the Swiss-German business located in Zurich, I was in charge of merchandising a product. I had to lead it to French customers. When I worked with IKEA Italy, I faced the same situation with a product from a Swedish business for Italian customers. That was a difficult challenge for a country where design is so important! So I set up workshops to adapt supply to demand. This permitted to surprise the Italian market offering Swedish design. I developed, created and initiated &ldquo;Little IKEA&rdquo; concept (for customers from 0 to 7 years old) for the first time in Torino, and now we can find it everywhere throughout the world. I&rsquo;m very proud of it!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Does everything begin with an analysis of the client? </strong></p><p>Not all, but a big part! We have to study customers&rsquo; habits. Let&rsquo;s take the example of Nespresso in Italy. Understanding which coffee Italians take, their customs or rules is an essential thing. An Italian begins his day with a cappuccino, and then a lungo, to finally finish with a macchiato and a ristreto. We have to understand the client so that the selling of a product works. According to Spartoo and Zappos, selling shoes online is another challenge for Europe which is used to selling shoes in shops. American women &ndash; most of the time in their car or living in an urban area &ndash; prefer to receive their shoes directly at home and try them instead of going to a shoe shop. So the website and politics of delivery and return are more important than the principal shop.</p><p>It&rsquo;s difficult for an expatriate to adapt himself to this type of purchases. Purchases customs can be studied in two ways. In order to understand these customers&rsquo; habits, besides believing in my intuition, I have to go on the field and observe people. Apple Stores are the best place for that; I stayed almost four hours in a shop to see what people bought, whether they returned products, came to see Genius or to try videogames&hellip; Thanks to that, I observed habits that helped me to better advice and understand customers.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Which role do you play in helping businesses to join in these new markets yet to conquer? </strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m a multicultural person and I know well those markets. I believe that my business helps to build bridges between United-States and Europe, but also Asia. In United-States, doing international actions in a very patriotic country is not that easy. Each state is a little country; each coast has its own culture. Lots of customers have never done a step outside their State. A business wanting to be implanted on the East Coast won&rsquo;t do the same market research as one wanting to be implanted on the West Coast or Midwest. I lead them for the development of a project as much in the strategic part as in the creative aspect.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What are the biggest mistakes of a business wanting to be implanted in a new market?</strong></p><p>First of all, they don&rsquo;t even wonder whether their proposition is going to work elsewhere. They all think that it will obviously work as much in United-States as in Europe, and vice versa. But it isn&rsquo;t as simple as that. Indeed, precise market studies &ndash; by State, city or district &ndash; are necessary to know whether their name is pronounceable. For instance, for some French businesses named &ldquo;<em>la cerise sur le g&acirc;teau&rdquo;</em> (in French, it literally means &ldquo;the cherry on the cake&rdquo;), it would be too long and unpronounceable in United-States. Then, it&rsquo;s important to have a good presentation.</p><p>American and French speeches are totally different: one will be more factual and precise, or we can say &ldquo;straight to the point&rdquo;, whereas the other will use clear and conceptual sentences, if not fictionalized. Businesses have to keep the origin, the DNA; that will be the added value. But they have to not forget the expectations of market and customers. Everything is important. Nevertheless, it isn&rsquo;t harder for little businesses, even if they have difficulties with the budget; they are ready to do great concessions. It is even harder for important businesses which have difficulties with calling into question. In both cases, they have to learn how to listen the different expectations.</p><p> </p><p><strong>In your opinion, which market is the hardest to join in?</strong></p><p>Each market has a part of difficulties, humility is necessary. There is no complicated market. Actually, there is only arrogance harming the business which wants to be exported. Lots of American businesses strongly believe that they are the best and clients are only waiting for their product. But French people will always prefer taking a coffee at a bistro or on the terrace instead of going to Starbucks. Italians will always take their pizza after going to the cinema instead of going to McDonald&rsquo;s. Then, the business has to start over and propose another experience; that&rsquo;s why Starbucks is trying to implant &ldquo;cosy&rdquo; spaces in France. Not forgetting that these countries are wide and the culture strong is important. Businesses have to follow the rhythm of these cultures and customs by living in the country for instance. The best I can advice is to be humble, this is the key to success. These facts are the same for European conquering United-States.</p><p> </p><p><strong>This market cross-cutting approach, you also applied it in your successive jobs, thing that needs a lot of flexibility. </strong></p><p>I went from the retail industry to the luxury market, leaving IKEA for Louis Vuitton. LV wanted me for my multicultural thinking and because I could manage a budget as precisely as we have to do in retail industry. Most of the time, French people work alone. I had to work hard to bring a cross-cutting approach for building a team of visual merchandising worldwide. Today, it has its own concepts for leather goods and the business is extended to fashion. Thanks to my artistic formation, my different experiences and the languages I can speak, I was able to speak with everybody. Working with Versace has been a new challenge for me. I had to create with the first CEO of the business a new production division for leather goods and accessorizes, redefining collections presentation and the organisation. This happened in a difficult context, that&rsquo;s to say five years after its founder&rsquo;s murder and with a tight budget. I had to work with Timex, Rosenthal, Luxotica and Euroitalia so that all the licenses would be placed in Versace&rsquo;s politics. Thanks to this job, I understood that I wanted to work in branding. This is what I do today in New York with my agency, to help little or important businesses to join in a new market and overall, to adopt a new culture.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Your job requires lots of skills. What do you prefer in your job? </strong></p><p>I hope I became more diplomatic, it&rsquo;s hard to show to businesses their difficulties. Now, being honest and direct, I know better how to balance my speeches. I also enjoy being the lawyer of several markets, the bridge, and the experience that will help history&rsquo;s business to grow and become more diverse. I think this career is a wonderful adventure, which links creativity with business development to finally result in Branding.</p><p> </p><p><strong>How do you think this &ldquo;adventure&rdquo; is going to evolve in? </strong></p><p>Why not in developing concepts for a multinational company; a famous business is always in need of new clients. Entrepreneurship develops skills and reflexes for different and unique situations. Besides my agency, I see myself teaching in a university, highlighting this creative and business aspect. For example, teaching and sharing the subtleties of Branding in classes of business development in a famous American school, sensitizing creative schools to &ldquo;growth opportunities&rdquo; challenges or bringing a creative/business opinion to students interested in technologies. I strongly believe that we have to reconcile humanities with technologies! So much beautiful projects, thus, and many cultural bridges to build!</p><p> </p><p> </p>",
