            hint: "FIRST STEP 
            To present your issue and help you describe your need, we advise you to follow this plan: 
            - describe the context in which your search fits best. It is important for the expert to be able to accurately identify it; 
            - portray what is at stake from your point of view; 
            - establish the objectives and define the scope(s) of the intervention, so that the expert can present you the start of a solution. 
            Please stay focused on the issue while drafting the text of the pitch: the contextual information (budget, dates, etc.) is to be provided in the second step. Before publishing the pitch, you will have the chance to review it in its totality."

            This second step collects the contextual information linked to the organization of the upcoming mission. 
            - Budget: it is a simple estimation at this point. It is purely declarative and it does not hold any contractual engagement. Further into your interaction with the experts, you can determine the method of execution and billing. 
            - Geographical area: it allows us to put you in contact only with those experts having worked in (at least) one of the areas selected. You may select all areas.  
            - Application Deadline: past this date, the consultation will be over and only those experts having answered before the indicated deadline will be up for selection. 
            - Start and End Dates of the mission: they are approximate but it will allow us to select only experts whose availability matches. 
            - Hidden Company Name: we offer you the possibility to hide the name of your company to keep the consultation confidential. 
            - On site presence required (partially): if the option is activated, only the experts available to travel to the location will be selected. "

            - Certification: you have the possibility to enrich your research with different certifications: you can either select one from the list we provide or create a new one. 
            - Languages: this criteria is important in order to make sure we reach out to experts speaking the same language(s) necessary to establish a stable evolution of the mission. 
            - Targeted Expertise: based on the information previously selected, the system offers you examples of documented expertise. Please select the one best fitting your research.
