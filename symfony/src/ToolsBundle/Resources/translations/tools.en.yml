            To present your issue and help you describe your need, we advise you to follow this plan:<br> 
            - describe the context in which your search fits best. It is important for the expert to be able to accurately identify it;<br> 
            - portray what is at stake from your point of view;<br> 
            - establish the objectives and define the scope(s) of the intervention, so that the expert can present you the start of a solution.<br> 
            Please stay focused on the issue while drafting the text of the pitch: the contextual information (budget, dates, etc.) is to be provided in the second step. Before publishing the pitch, you will have the chance to review it in its totality."

                Consultants.wantmore.work identified the main consulting missions for you. Choose the one that better describes your issue. In order to present your issue and help you describe your need, we advise you to follow our plan :<br>
                - describe the context in which your search fits best. It is important for the expert to be able to accurately identify it<br>
                - portray what is at stake from your point of view<br>
                - establish the objectives and define the scope(s) of the intervention, so that the expert can present you the start of a solution. <br>
                Please stay focused on the issue while drafting the text of the pitch : the contextual information (budget, dates, etc.) is to be provided in the second step. Before publishing the pitch, you will have the chance to review it in its totality.<br><br>
                Step 2: <br><br>

                - Geographical area : it allows us to put you in contact with only those experts having worked in (at least) one of the areas selected. You may select all areas.<br>
                - Application Deadline : past this date, the consultation will be over and only those experts having answered before the indicated deadline will be up for selection.<br>
                - Start and End Dates of the mission: they are approximate but it will allow us to select only experts whose availability matches.<br>
                - Hidden Company Name: we offer you the possibility to hide the name of your company to keep the consultation confidential.<br>
                - On site presence required (partially) : if the option is activated, only the experts available to travel to the location will be selected.<br><br>
                Step 3 :<br><br>
                - Certification : you have the possibility to enrich your research with different certifications - you can either select one from the list we provide or create a new one.<br>
                - Langues : this criteria is important in order to make sure we reach out to experts speaking the same language(s). This is necessary to establish a stable evolution of the mission.<br>
                - Desiered Expertise : based on the information previously selected, the system offeres you examples of documented expertise. Please select the one best fitting your research. <br>
                Having taken into consideration all the information provided, Consultants.wantmore.work shows you the number of experts present in our database capable to deal with your issue as well as their average daily rates. You can change this average daily rate by establishing a limit.<br><br>
                Step 4:<br><br>
                - Pitch Review : Please check the accuracy of the inforamtion before publishing the pitch. You may edit the information previously provided during this review process. Once the pitch is published you will no longer be able to edit it.<br><br>
                Step 5: <br><br>
